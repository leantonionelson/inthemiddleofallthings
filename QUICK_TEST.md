# Quick Test for Audio Fix

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP - Clear Everything!

The issue you're experiencing is likely **caching**. You MUST clear all caches before testing:

### Method 1: Nuclear Option (Recommended)
1. **Close all browser tabs** with your app open
2. **Open DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. **Go to Application tab**
4. **Click "Clear site data"** button (under Application > Storage)
5. **Check ALL boxes**:
   - Local and session storage
   - IndexedDB
   - Web SQL
   - Cookies
   - Cache storage
   - Service workers
6. **Click "Clear site data"**
7. **Close and reopen the browser**

### Method 2: Manual Cleaning
1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Unregister Service Worker**:
   - Application → Service Workers
   - Click "Unregister" next to your service worker
3. **Clear Cache Storage**:
   - Application → Cache Storage
   - Right-click each cache → Delete
4. **Clear Local Storage**:
   - Application → Local Storage
   - Right-click your site → Clear
5. **Hard Reload**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Reload the page
4. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 GenericAudioService: Constructor called, loading audio indexes...
   🔍 GenericAudioService: Fetching /media/audio/chapters/index.json
   🔍 GenericAudioService: Fetching /media/audio/meditations/index.json
   🔍 GenericAudioService: Fetching /media/audio/stories/index.json
   📄 Loaded chapters audio index with X items
   📄 Loaded meditations audio index with X items
   📄 Loaded stories audio index with X items
   🔍 GenericAudioService: Audio indexes loaded successfully
   ```

**Expected values:**
- chapters: 58 items (29 unique with male & female)
- meditations: 9 items
- stories: 1 item

### Test 2: Check Network Requests
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Reload the page
3. Filter by "index.json"
4. You should see 3 successful requests (Status 200):
   - `/media/audio/chapters/index.json`
   - `/media/audio/meditations/index.json`
   - `/media/audio/stories/index.json`

**If you see 404 errors**, the files aren't being served properly.

### Test 3: Verify Play Buttons
1. **Navigate to Book Reader** → Play button should be active (not grey)
2. **Navigate to Meditations** → Play buttons should be active for these 9:
   - Between Two Breaths
   - Beyond Morals
   - Layers of Perspective
   - Life is Not a Problem
   - Pain as Teacher
   - Perspective and Time
   - Recognition, Not Pursuit
   - The Anchor of Breath
   - The Angle of Seeing
3. **Navigate to Stories** → Play button should be active for "INTRUDENT"

### Test 4: Check Audio Loading
When you click a play button, look for:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Checking audio for item: {...}
🔍 Checking for pre-generated audio: [Title] (ID: [id], Voice: female, Type: meditations)
🔍 Looking for selected voice: [id]_female.wav - Found/Not found
🔍 Final result: Has pre-generated audio
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If meditations/stories are still greyed out:

1. **Check if index files exist**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/media/audio/meditations/index.json`
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/media/audio/stories/index.json`
   - Both should show JSON content (not 404)

2. **Check the console for errors**:
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Look for "No audio index loaded for meditations/stories"
   - Share any errors you see

3. **Verify dev server is running**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check if you're running production build**:
   - If using `npm run preview`, rebuild first:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm run preview
     ```

5. **Try a different browser** (to rule out cache issues)

### If you see "404" for index.json files:

The files might not be copied to the right location. Run:
```bash
node scripts/updateAudioIndex.js
npm run build
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Console shows all 3 index files loaded
2. ✅ Play buttons are NOT grey for book chapters
3. ✅ Play buttons are NOT grey for the 9 meditations listed
4. ✅ Play button is NOT grey for INTRUDENT story
5. ✅ Clicking play button loads and plays audio

## 📊 Debug Output

If it's still not working, share this info:
1. Browser console output (copy/paste)
2. Network tab showing the 3 index.json requests
3. Any error messages
4. Which page(s) still show grey buttons
