# 🚀 Quick Test - Do This Now

## You're absolutely right about the fragmented system!

I've completely rebuilt it with **ONE unified service** that handles everything consistently. No more different logic for chapters vs meditations vs stories.

## ⚡ Test in 3 Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL!)
```
Open DevTools (F12) → Application → "Clear site data" → Close browser → Reopen
```

OR just use an **Incognito/Private window**

### 2. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Console & Navigate
- Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
- Navigate to Meditations or Stories
- Look for these logs:

**You should see:**
```
📦 UnifiedContentService: Loading all audio indexes...
✅ Loaded meditation audio index: 9 items
✅ Loaded story audio index: 1 items
🔍 Checking audio for meditation: "Beyond Morals" (ID: beyond-morals)
🔍 Audio check for meditation/beyond-morals: AVAILABLE
✅ Audio check complete for "Beyond Morals": HAS AUDIO
```

**Play buttons should be:**
- ✅ Book chapters: ALL active (not grey)
- ✅ Meditations: 9 active (not grey)  
- ✅ Stories: 1 active (not grey)

## 🐛 If still grey, share this:

1. Copy/paste the console output
2. Tell me which content type is still grey
3. Check Network tab for any 404 errors

The new system has **clear logging at every step**, so we'll know exactly what's happening!

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before:** Fragmented system with race conditions  
**Now:** ONE unified service, consistent behavior everywhere
