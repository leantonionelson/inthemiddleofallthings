# Firebase client-side API keys are MEANT to be public (they're protected by Firebase security rules)
# Netlify's secrets scanner detects them in the build output, causing deployment failures
# 
# SOLUTION: In Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables, add:
#   SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED = false
#
# This is safe because:
# 1. Firebase client keys are designed to be public (used in browsers)
# 2. Security is enforced by Firebase Security Rules, not by hiding keys
# 3. These keys only work with your specific Firebase project configuration

# Environment variables for Netlify Functions
# Add RESEND_API_KEY in Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables
# The value should be: re_6djHv3CP_DAzCmamCL1wRVx8d5KZZNYK2
