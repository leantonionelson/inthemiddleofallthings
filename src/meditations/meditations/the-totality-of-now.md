Everything is here.
Not yesterday.
Not tomorrow.
Here.

The mind scatters itselfâ€”
replaying what has gone,
rehearsing what might come.
But life does not scatter.
Life only ever gathers,
concentrated in the single point
you call now.

Everything is in the moment.
The breath you take.
The sound around you.
The weight of your body against the earth.
Even your thoughts of past and future
are happening here,
folded into this moment.

Pause here.
Breathe deeply.
Ask yourself:
What, right now, is lacking?
The lack you feel is usually a thought,
a shadow of another time.
But in this exact now,
you are whole enough to be aware.
And awareness is fullness.

To live in the moment is not to deny time.
It is to anchor within it.
To see that the past is memory,
the future is possibility,
but both only exist
because now is holding them.

Everything is in the moment.
Your joy.
Your sorrow.
Your healing.
Your becoming.
There is nothing outside of it,
though we spend our lives looking elsewhere.

Rest here.
Notice how simple life becomes
when reduced to this breath,
this sound,
this awareness.
Not simple as in small,
but simple as in complete.

Everything is in the moment.
And in remembering that,
you recover the only thing
you ever truly had.
