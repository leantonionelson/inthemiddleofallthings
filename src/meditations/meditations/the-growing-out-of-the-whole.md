We imagine ourselves as arrivals —
souls dropped into matter,
foreign guests inhabiting a world
that existed before us.
But this is illusion.
We do not come into this world;
we come out of it.
As leaves grow from the tree,
we grow from the universe.

You are not in nature —
you are nature.
You are the living continuation
of everything that has ever been.

Pause here.
Feel the ground beneath you.
It does not hold you as a surface
but feeds you as a source.
The carbon in your breath
once burned in stars.
The calcium in your bones
was once the dust of mountains.
You are not a visitor here;
you are a verse in an eternal poem
still being written.

Leaves do not ask the tree for meaning.
Their purpose is their being.
Their fall is their return.
Their decay feeds their own roots.
So too with you.
The breath you exhale
nourishes the air of others.
The love you give
re-enters the soil of consciousness
and grows again somewhere unseen.

We come out of this world,
not into it.
The distinction changes everything.
It replaces loneliness with belonging,
fear with continuity.

To know this
is to dissolve the border
between self and cosmos.
To realise that when you touch your own skin,
you touch the edge of the universe.

So live like a leaf—
unafraid to grow,
unashamed to fall,
content to feed what comes next.

You are not apart.
You are the world
looking back at itself and smiling.
