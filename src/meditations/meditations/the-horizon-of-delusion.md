# The Horizon of Delusion

Possibility is boundless.
Unwritten.
Unfixed.
It stretches in every direction like a sky with no edges.

But we do not live in boundlessness.
We live in agreement.
The shared delusion.
The rules we inherit and rehearse.
Money. Borders. Time. Identity.
These are not truths of the universe.
They are structures we agreed to believe in.
And because we agree, they become real.

Anything is possibleâ€”
but not while we are bound by the stories we refuse to question.

Pause here.
Think of the invisible lines you obey daily.
The ones you never touch,
but always feel.
Traffic lights. Calendars. Etiquette.
Sacred because we all pretend together.

The delusion is not evil.
It is useful.
It makes coordination possible.
It allows civilisation to move as one body.
But the danger comes when we forget
that it is chosen.
That it could be otherwise.

Anything is possible.
But first, you must notice the spell you are under.
The unquestioned scripts.
The inherited limits.
The quiet obedience to a system
that was only ever provisional.

Ask yourself:
Which delusions am I willing to carry,
because they serve love, connection, creation?
And which ones must I break,
because they serve only fear, control, division?

The horizon of possibility
is not out there.
It begins at the edge of what you no longer believe in.

Anything is possible if not for our shared delusion.
And sometimes, to create a new world,
you need only to stop agreeing with the old one.
