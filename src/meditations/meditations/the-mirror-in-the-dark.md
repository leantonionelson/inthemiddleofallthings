Light is easy to love.
It flatters, it comforts,
it confirms our goodness.
But it is the darkness within us
that teaches depth,
that grows empathy,
that makes compassion possible.

Knowing your own darkness
is the best method
for dealing with the darknesses of other people.
Because only those who have met
their own shadows without flinching
can sit calmly
in the shadows of another.

Close your eyes.
Remember a time you faced
something in yourself you wished weren't there –
anger, envy, shame, fear.
Feel how it pulsed beneath the surface,
begging not to be judged
but to be seen.
That moment –
that willingness to see without denial –
was the birth of understanding.

When you know your own darkness,
you stop expecting perfection
from anyone.
You stop being shocked by human behaviour.
You see the pain behind the mask,
the wound behind the act,
the longing behind the cruelty.

This knowing does not excuse harm,
but it transforms your reaction to it.
You no longer meet darkness with outrage;
you meet it with awareness.
You know the terrain.
You have walked it.
You can guide others through it.

The unexamined soul fights shadow with shadow.
The examined soul
extends a lantern.

Your own darkness
is not a flaw to be fixed;
it is material for wisdom.
It teaches humility,
forgiveness,
and truth.
It reminds you that light
is only meaningful
because it once knew night.

So befriend the dark within you.
Name it.
Learn its language.
For when you do,
you'll find you no longer fear
the darkness in others –
you simply recognise
the part of yourself
still learning how to heal.
