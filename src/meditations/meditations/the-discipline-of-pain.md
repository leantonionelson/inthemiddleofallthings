Relax.
Feel the pain.
Relax into it.
Trust it —
and move,
stretch,
contract.

Pain is not the enemy.
It is the body's conversation
with awareness.

Most flee from it.
But pain, when met,
becomes teacher.
It reveals what resists.

Pause here.
Find a discomfort —
physical or emotional.
Instead of tightening,
breathe into it.
Notice how it changes shape
when met with presence.

Pain dissolves fragility.
It burns away fear.
When you relax into pain,
you do not break —
you are refined.
