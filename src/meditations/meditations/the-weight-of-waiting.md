# The Weight of Waiting

Waiting is not empty time.
It is time filled with potential.

You sit in the space between
what was and what will be,
and this space has substance.
It has gravity.
It pulls at you.

The mind wants to fill it
with planning,
with worry,
with rehearsal.
But waiting asks for something else.

Presence.
The radical act
of being here
without knowing what comes next.

Feel the weight of not knowing.
It is heavier than certainty,
but it is also more honest.

In waiting, you discover
that you are larger
than your need to control.
That you can hold uncertainty
without being crushed by it.

The seed waits in darkness.
The tide waits to turn.
The heart waits between beats.

This is not passivity.
This is active trustâ€”
the courage to let time
do what time does:
reveal what needs revealing
when it needs to be revealed.

So wait well.
Wait with intention.
Wait as if waiting itself
were a form of prayer.

Because it is.
