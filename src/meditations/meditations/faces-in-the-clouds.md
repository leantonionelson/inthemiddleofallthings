# Faces in the Clouds

Lying here,
watching faces form and fade in the clouds,
I glimpse the divine in the act of seeing.

It must be what God feels
when looking at us –
each shape appearing briefly,
beautiful, absurd, alive,
then dissolving into formlessness again.

Look at the sky,
or at the passing thoughts within it.
They are the same.
Each moment forms a face,
a story, a self –
then drifts away.

To see creation is to join it,
for perception completes the act.
The clouds do not mean anything
until you imagine them.
And perhaps we, too,
are only visible
because something imagines us.

Let them come,
let them go.
The beauty is in the appearing,
and the grace is in the fading.
