Explore when curious.
Extract what's valuable.
Let go of what doesn't serve.

Curiosity is the soul's compass.
It points toward aliveness.
But even wonder
must know when to release.

Pause here.
Notice what you're drawn to today.
Ask what lesson it offers —
then thank it
and move on.

Growth depends on motion.
The mind stagnates
where attachment sets in.

Take what feeds you.
Leave what confines you.
The wise traveller
collects experience,
not possessions.

Curiosity opens the door.
Discernment knows when to close it.
