Even error has symmetry.
Even the mistaken view
leans toward truth in its distortion.
For to be wrong completely
would require a kind of perfect blindness –
a precision of ignorance
no mind could maintain.

No one is smart enough
to be wrong all the time.

Reality leaks through everything.
Even in falsehood,
a glimmer of truth remains,
a shard of light embedded in the shadow.
And it is this that makes understanding possible –
that even confusion
is an attempt at coherence,
an imperfect reflection of what is.

Think of someone whose view opposes yours.
Notice how quickly the mind wants to dismiss,
to label, to defend.
Now soften.
Ask, What fragment of truth might be hiding there?
You may not agree,
but in every position,
something valid struggles to express itself.
It may be clumsy,
it may be warped by fear,
but it is never entirely void.

Wisdom is not the absence of error,
but the ability to find truth inside it.
The universe speaks through contrast,
through the friction of opposites.
If you listen with patience,
even those who challenge you most
become your teachers.

No one is smart enough
to be wrong all the time.
And that includes you.
Even in your worst moments –
when you misunderstand,
when you fail,
when you hurt or are hurt –
life is still revealing something essential.
Your error is your education.

This awareness dissolves arrogance.
It replaces judgement with curiosity.
And in that curiosity,
the world becomes gentler,
less divided.
You begin to see that truth
does not belong to anyone –
it permeates everyone,
expressing itself through the imperfect language
of human limitation.

So when you meet opposition,
pause before correction.
Look for the thread of truth
woven into their mistake.
You'll find it every time.
For no one,
not even the foolish,
are clever enough
to shut out truth completely.
