# Morning Intention

**Tags:** morning, intention, beginning, purpose, awareness, fresh-start

---

Before the day takes you,
take the day.

Sit with the silence
before the noise begins.
Feel the stillness
before the movement starts.

Ask yourself:
What do I want to bring
to this day?
Not what the day will demand,
but what I choose to offer.

Patience?
Curiosity?
Compassion?
Presence?

Set this intention
not as a burden to carry,
but as a light to follow.

When the day becomes heavy,
when the path becomes unclear,
return to this moment.
Return to this choice.

You cannot control
what the day will bring,
but you can choose
how you will meet it.

With intention.
With awareness.
With the remembering
that every moment
is a new beginning.

Rise.
The day is waiting
for who you choose to be.
