# The Weightless Possession

---

I have every material need.

Not every want –
but every need.
And that is wealth enough.

Look around.
What in this moment
is lacking?
Breath? Shelter? Warmth?

Sufficiency is a state of recognition,
not acquisition.
The more you notice what is enough,
the lighter life becomes.

Gratitude dissolves greed.
Simplicity restores joy.
When nothing is missing,
you finally have room
to live.
