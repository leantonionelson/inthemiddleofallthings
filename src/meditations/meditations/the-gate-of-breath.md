The simplest act is the most sacred.
Breathing—so constant,
so unnoticed—
yet the thread by which all life is held.

Open your nostrils and breathe.
Feel the air enter,
cool, alive, unseen.
Feel it leave,
warm with the trace of you.

This is not just air.
It is exchange.
The trees breathe you,
you breathe them.
The ocean, the wind, the sky—
all passing through your nostrils now.

Pause here.
Notice how the body shifts
when the breath is conscious.
The chest softens.
The mind loosens.
The present sharpens.

Breathing is the first thing you did.
It will be the last.
Between them,
it is the quiet rhythm that keeps you here.

Open your nostrils and breathe.
As if for the first time.
As if each inhale is gift.
As if each exhale is offering.

Do not complicate it.
Do not seek more than this.
The breath is teacher enough.
It shows you impermanence—
in and out,
rise and fall.
It shows you abundance—
there is always another waiting.
It shows you trust—
you do not summon it;
it comes.

Open your nostrils and breathe.
It is the simplest prayer.
The most ancient meditation.
The unspoken reminder that
to exist at all
is already miracle.
