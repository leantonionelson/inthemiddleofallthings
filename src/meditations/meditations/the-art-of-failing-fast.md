# The Art of Failing Fast

Innovation requires failure –
so take a fail-fast approach.

Failure is not a verdict;
it is a method.
It refines the possible
by burning away illusion.

Recall the last time you hesitated,
afraid to try.
Ask yourself –
what if failure were feedback
instead of flaw?

The mind fears endings,
but invention loves them.
Every collapse
marks the removal of a wrong turn.

Fail fast,
but fail consciously.
Look closely at what broke
and why.
Then build again
without the excess weight.

The secret of mastery
is not perfection,
but iteration.
Fall forward.
Rise informed.

Every failure
is a rehearsal
for wisdom.
