# The Return of Nothing

Everything you see—
the stars, the oceans, your very breath—
came from nothing.
Not emptiness as absence,
but emptiness as origin.

The universe rose from silence.
And silence will claim it again.
Worlds collapse.
Galaxies dim.
Even time, that great river,
will dry to stillness.

But from that stillness,
the pattern stirs again.
Not once,
not twice,
but eternally.

If it came from nothing,
it will return to nothing.
And if it can return,
it can rise once more.
Nothing is not an end.
It is the womb.
The reset.
The fertile dark from which all light emerges.

Pause here.
Notice the exhale.
It feels like ending,
but it is also clearing.
Without the exhale,
there is no space for the inhale.
Without nothing,
there is no place for everything.

This is the great cycle:
existence blooming,
existence fading,
existence blooming again.

And so you are not fragile.
You are not at risk of final loss.
You are woven into a rhythm
that cannot be stopped.
Even in vanishing,
you remain.

If the universe fades to nothing,
it will happen again eternally.
Because nothing does not end the story.
It begins it.
Every time.
