# The Reset Through Pain

Find the pain
to reset thoughts.

When the mind spirals,
return to the body.
Pain – even slight –
anchors awareness.

Pinch your fingers together,
press your feet to the floor.
Feel that – real.
Thoughts cannot spiral
where presence is planted.

Pain brings you back to now.
In its edge,
clarity is sharpened.

Use sensation
to reclaim focus.
The body never lies –
it only calls you home.
