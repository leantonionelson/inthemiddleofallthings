The world will try to name you.
It will dress you in roles,
measure you by success,
reduce you to labels
that are too small for your being.

And sometimes,
you will believe them.
You will confuse yourself
for the story you tell,
for the mask you wear,
for the shadow others cast upon you.

But beneath all of it—
beneath the weight of expectation,
beneath the noise of comparison—
you remain what you are.

Never forget this.

You are not just a body.
Though the body is sacred,
it is only one garment of your being.
You are not just thought.
Though thought is powerful,
it is only one current of your mind.
You are not just your past.
Though past shapes,
it does not contain you.

Pause here.
Breathe.
Ask yourself softly:
What am I, without my name?
What am I, without my story?
What am I, when no one is looking?

The answer cannot be spoken.
But it is felt.
A stillness.
A presence.
A light that does not depend on recognition.

Never forget what you are.
Not the costume.
Not the role.
But the essence that remains
even when all else falls away.

Hold to that remembering.
For when the world tries to define you,
you will not be swayed.
When doubt creeps in,
you will not collapse.
When fear presses close,
you will not mistake yourself for it.

Never forget what you are.
Because in that remembering
is your freedom.
