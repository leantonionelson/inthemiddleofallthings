Every face is a mask of the infinite.
Every eye you meet
is a window through which eternity peers back.
But most of the time,
we are too busy seeing people
to recognise presence.

Treat everyone you meet
like God in disguise.
Not as metaphor,
but as reality —
for what else could they be?
Every being is a temporary expression
of the same source,
a fragment of divinity
playing at individuality.

Pause here.
Think of someone who frustrates you,
someone who tests your patience.
Now strip away their name,
their story,
their role in your life.
What remains?
A pulse,
a consciousness,
a spark of the same life
that animates you.

When you treat another as divine,
you remind them of what they are
and remember what you are.
The distance between giver and receiver dissolves,
for love becomes recognition.

The beggar,
the friend,
the stranger,
the rival —
each one is the infinite
wearing a new face
to see how you'll respond.

God hides in the mundane
because only through the veil of ordinariness
can compassion be tested.
Every encounter is an initiation —
a chance to look beyond the mask
and bow to the eternal within it.

Treat everyone you meet
like God in disguise.
Not out of duty,
but out of reverence.
Because when you finally stop reserving divinity
for altars and heavens,
you'll find it everywhere —
in laughter,
in sorrow,
in the eyes of the next person you pass.

And then one day,
when you look in the mirror,
you will remember:
the disguise was yours too.
