True meditation
is not focus —
it is surrender.

Focus holds.
Surrender releases.
And in release
the mind finds its natural rhythm —
like water returning to the sea.

Pause here.
Close your eyes.
Notice the breath
without trying to control it.
It breathes itself.
Awareness watches.

Meditation is not the doing of silence;
it is the falling into it.
When you cease to reach,
you begin to rest.

Surrender is the highest discipline —
the art of no effort.
