# The Equation of Joy

Happiness = Reality ÷ Expectation.

It is not found in possession,
but in proportion.
When expectation expands
faster than awareness,
contentment breaks.

Pause here.
Name one thing
you wish were different.
Now imagine
being grateful
for it as it is.

The mind inflates want.
The heart measures truth.

Happiness is not the adding of more,
but the adjusting of scale.
When reality is enough
for gratitude to stand on,
joy becomes simple mathematics.
