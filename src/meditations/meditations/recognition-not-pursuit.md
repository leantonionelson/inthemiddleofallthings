# Recognition, Not Pursuit

Love confuses us because we try to grasp it.
We turn it into pursuit,
a test,
a question with endless answers.
But real love does not require such effort.
It is recognition.

Always remember—
if she is the one,
she is the one.
No proving.
No chasing.
No bargaining with fate.
Only the quiet knowing
that settles deeper than thought.

Pause here.
Think of the times you doubted love,
the times you tried to force it into shape,
to make it what it was not.
Notice the strain of that.
Now recall the moments of certainty,
when love was simple,
when you knew without explanation.
That is the difference.

If she is the one,
you will not need to cling.
The truth of it will not waver
with fear or circumstance.
It will endure—
not as constant feeling,
but as unbroken orientation.

Love does not mean ease.
There will still be struggle,
still be distance,
still be change.
But beneath all of it,
the axis remains unmoved.

Always remember.
Because in doubt you will be tempted
to complicate what is simple,
to let fear dress itself as reason.
Do not.
Return instead to the still centre.
If she is the one,
she is the one.
That truth does not need your anxiety.
It only needs your trust.
