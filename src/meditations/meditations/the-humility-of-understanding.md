# The Humility of Understanding

Never volunteer an answer
to a question
you do not understand.

To speak without seeing
is to echo ignorance.
Curiosity precedes counsel.

Pause here.
Remember a time you rushed to answer,
only to find
you were addressing the wrong question.
Knowledge lives in listening first.

Understanding is humility in motion.
It bows before mystery
until clarity invites response.

Let silence prepare the mind,
so that when you speak,
truth recognises its own voice.
