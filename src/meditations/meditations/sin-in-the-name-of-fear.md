Sin in the name of fear
is the worst of all sins.

Fear masquerades as virtue –
it claims to protect,
to caution,
to save.
But beneath its robe
is control.

We harm what we fear losing,
and justify it as righteousness.
History is written
in trembling hands
that believed they were clean.

Recall a time you chose safety
over sincerity,
silence over truth.
Did the peace last?
Or did it calcify into shame?

Courage is not the absence of fear;
it is the refusal to worship it.
Act from love, not alarm.
Love sees clearly,
fear distorts.

Sin committed from desire
may yet lead to learning.
But sin committed from fear
teaches only separation.

Choose the brave compassion
that does not hide behind holiness.
