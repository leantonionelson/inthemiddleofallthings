Truth bends with the light that reveals it.
Not because truth lies,
but because sight is partial –
and every eye,
every mind,
every soul
sees through its own horizon.

The truth is governed by perspective.
What is high ground to one
is shadowed valley to another.
What feels eternal today
will fade beneath tomorrow's sun.

Think of a moment you were certain –
utterly convinced of your rightness.
Then recall when time,
or pain,
or distance
shifted that certainty into something softer.
Nothing changed but your vantage,
and yet everything did.

Perspective does not corrupt truth.
It refines it.
Each angle adds dimension.
Each witness completes another fragment of the whole.
We argue about which reflection is real
and forget that all mirrors point to the same light.

To see truly
is not to fix truth in place,
but to allow it to move.
To understand that it grows
as you do –
widening, unfolding,
revealing more of what was always there.

The truth is governed by perspective.
That is why humility is sacred.
It keeps your seeing honest.
It reminds you that your clarity
is still a corner of the vast.

So speak your truth –
but hold it gently.
Listen to others –
not to defend,
but to expand.
Because when all perspectives align,
what we call "truth"
finally steps out of shadow
and becomes whole.
