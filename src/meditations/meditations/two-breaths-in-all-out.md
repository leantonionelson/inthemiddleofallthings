# Two Breaths In, All Out

The body is rhythm.
It knows before the mind.
It teaches without words.

Two breaths in.
All out.

This is not a technique.
It is a mirror.
A reminder that life is not symmetrical.
Inhale requires effort.
Exhale is release.

You take twice what you need—
air, nourishment, experience—
and then let it go completely.
Nothing hoarded.
Nothing clutched.

Two breaths in.
All out.

To live is to expand,
to gather,
to fill.
But to remain alive is to let it go.
Not half of it.
All of it.

The rhythm whispers:
Receive more than enough.
Release more than you keep.

This is generosity.
This is forgiveness.
This is how the body survives.

And if the body is the teacher,
then the spirit is the student.
It learns that holding is never permanent.
That even the deepest breath
is only borrowed.

So pause.
Inhale once.
Feel the rise.
Inhale again.
Feel the stretch.
Now exhale—
longer than you thought possible.
Emptying.
Clearing.
Trusting that the next breath will come.

Two breaths in.
All out.

It is not balance you are seeking.
It is surrender.
The courage to be filled,
and the courage to be emptied.
Again and again,
until life itself becomes the breathing.
