# The Integrity of Self

Conflict is part of life.
Not everyone will see you clearly.
Not everyone will wish you well.
And some will try to reduce you—
to a mistake,
to a role,
to the image they need you to be.

This is the danger.
Not that they oppose you.
But that you begin to believe them.
That you let their definition
replace your own.

The only way you can lose
is by letting the enemy define who you are.

Pause here.
Think of the names you've been called.
The judgments you've carried.
The ways you've been misunderstood.
Notice how heavy they felt
only when you gave them power.
Without your agreement,
they are just echoes in the air.

Your essence cannot be stolen.
It can only be surrendered.
And surrender happens
when you forget to return to your own centre.

So return.
Breathe.
Say inwardly: I know who I am.
Not perfect.
Not complete.
But true.
Yours.

Enemies will always exist—
sometimes outside,
sometimes within.
But their voices do not define you.
They only test the strength
of your remembrance.

The only way you can lose
is by letting the enemy define who you are.
Do not hand them that victory.
Stand inside your own name.
Stand inside your own light.
And let every attempt to diminish you
fall away,
unable to reach the truth of what you are.
