# The Meeting Place

See and approach people
who and where they are.

Do not demand
that they meet you
at your altitude.
Descent can be divine.

Pause here.
Think of someone
you find difficult to understand.
Now imagine standing beside them,
not above them.
Ask what their pain
might be trying to protect.

Understanding is not agreement.
It is proximity.
We grow close enough
to remember our sameness.

Meet others as you would meet yourself —
patiently,
in progress,
still learning how to love.
