Don't chase happiness.
Choose peace.

Happiness depends on weather.
Peace belongs to climate.

Happiness arrives when things align;
peace endures when they don't.

Pause here.
Name something you're waiting for —
a result, a recognition,
a resolution.
Now imagine being content
even if it never comes.

That is peace.

Peace is not the denial of pain;
it is the refusal
to let pain define you.

Happiness changes with circumstance.
Peace transforms circumstance
into wisdom.

Choose peace.
Let happiness follow if it wishes.
