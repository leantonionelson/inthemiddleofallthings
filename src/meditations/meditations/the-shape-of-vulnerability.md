Strength hides easily.
It wears armour,
it speaks loud,
it convinces the world that it is untouchable.

But vulnerability—
vulnerability is the quiet truth beneath it.
The place where the armour cracks.
The place where the voice falters.
The place where you risk being seen
and not being chosen.

To be vulnerable is not to collapse.
It is not weakness.
It is presence,
without the shield.

Learn how to be vulnerable.
It is a skill,
a discipline of openness.

Start with the body.
The soft belly.
The unclenched jaw.
The eyes that do not dart away.
This is what it looks like
to let life enter you
without defence.

Then the heart.
The words you don't want to say—
"I don't know."
"I need help."
"I love you."
They are heavy at first,
but lighter once released.

Then the soul.
The part of you that admits
you are unfinished.
That even your certainty is trembling.
That you are here,
not to prove,
but to reveal.

Learn how to be vulnerable.
Because only in that state
do you truly connect.
Armour meets armour
and the world stays hard.
But when your softness meets another's,
something sacred opens.
Something that cannot be faked.

Pause here.
Ask yourself:
Where am I still pretending?
Where am I still guarded?
Where am I still convincing the world
I am stronger than I feel?

And then—
just for a moment—
let the armour slide off.
Not forever.
Just long enough
to remember
that you are not loved for your mask,
but for the pulse that beats beneath it.

Learn how to be vulnerable.
It is the only way to know love
as more than an idea.
