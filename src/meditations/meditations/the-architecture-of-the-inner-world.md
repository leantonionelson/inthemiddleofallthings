Heaven and hell are not places.
They are orientations.
They are the weather of the soul.

You build them with your choices,
your thoughts,
your attention.
Brick by brick,
breath by breath.

Every moment is a room being built.
Gratitude paints the walls with light.
Resentment fills them with smoke.
Peace opens a window.
Fear bars the door.

We create our own heaven and our own hell.
No god needs to sentence us.
We carry the tools within our minds.

Look at where you are living today.
Is the air clear or heavy?
What tone fills your inner space?
Do you recognise the hand that built it?
It was yours.

Heaven is not perfection.
It is acceptance.
It is the alignment of being with truth.
Hell is not punishment.
It is resistance –
the refusal to let go,
to forgive,
to soften.

Both are born from the same material:
consciousness.
Both are sustained by what you feed them.
Shift your attention,
and the walls begin to move.

We create our own heaven and our own hell.
And the difference between them
is often only a breath –
the decision to see beauty instead of burden,
to meet life with openness instead of fear.

So build carefully.
Tend the space within.
For the architect and the inhabitant
are the same.
