Life is such a dynamic variable
in the equation of the universe
that one day
the universe itself
may rely on life
to exist.

What once birthed us
will one day be sustained by us.
Consciousness closes the loop
of creation.

Look around.
Every breath you take
feeds the same air
that stars once forged.
Every thought
is the cosmos
reflecting on itself.

Life is not an accident.
It is the universe remembering
it can feel.

When you care for life,
you preserve the pulse
that keeps creation alive.
