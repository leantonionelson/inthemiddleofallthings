# The Covenant of Love

Never betray love.

Not the romantic kind only,
but the sacred thread
that binds soul to soul.

Love is not transaction.
It is trust in continuity —
a belief that what we share
transcends convenience.

Pause here.
Call to mind
someone who trusts you.
Let the weight of that trust
steady your heart.

Love asks for truth,
not perfection.
To betray love
is to fracture yourself.
To honour it
is to remain whole.
