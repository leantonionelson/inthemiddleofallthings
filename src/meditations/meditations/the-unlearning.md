Beliefs are scaffolding.
They hold us upright while we build,
but they are not the structure itself.
They are meant to be dismantled
once the soul outgrows their shape.

Be open to the re-examination of your core beliefs.
Because the danger of certainty
is that it fossilises wonder.
And when wonder dies,
so does growth.

Think of a belief you once held as truth –
a conviction that once felt unshakable.
Now recall the moment it began to tremble,
the first crack that let light through.
Was that loss,
or was it awakening?

The mind resists revision,
but life insists on it.
Every experience is a teacher
asking, Are you still sure?
Every heartbreak, every revelation
is a quiet curriculum of transformation.

To re-examine is not betrayal.
It is devotion to truth.
It is saying to the universe:
"I am willing to be wrong,
so that I might become more whole."

Core beliefs are living things.
They must breathe,
shed skin,
die and be reborn.
Hold them gently,
let them evolve with your seeing.

The wise are not those who know,
but those who keep unknowing.
They meet reality not with conclusions,
but with curiosity.

Be open to the re-examination of your core beliefs.
Because truth is not a monument –
it is a movement.
And to walk with it
is to accept that even your most sacred foundations
will one day ask to be remade.
