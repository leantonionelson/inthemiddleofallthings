Extremes are seductive.
They promise certainty –
the comfort of choosing a side,
the illusion of clarity in a world of grey.
But truth does not live at the edges.
It moves quietly between them.

Find the middle way.

Not the compromise born of fear,
but the balance born of understanding.
The middle is not indecision.
It is precision.
It is the still point
where both opposites meet and dissolve.

Feel your breath.
Inhale –one pole.
Exhale –the other.
Between them,
a brief stillness,
a space untouched by either.
That space is the middle way.
That is where peace begins.

To live in the middle
is to stop fighting gravity.
To stop calling darkness an enemy of light.
To see that both are partners
in the same dance of being.

Find the middle way.
In anger, it is patience.
In sorrow, it is acceptance.
In joy, it is humility.
It is the quiet knowing
that wholeness is not gained
by leaning,
but by resting in alignment.

The middle way is not narrow.
It is infinite.
Because when you stand in the centre,
you see in all directions.
You become the axis
around which opposites spin.

Find the middle way.
You will not lose passion.
You will find purpose.
You will not lose conviction.
You will find clarity.
And in the stillness between all things,
you will discover the one thing
that was never divided –
you.
