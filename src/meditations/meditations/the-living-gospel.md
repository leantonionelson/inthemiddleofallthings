It is better to be a follower
of the religion of Jesus
than a follower
of the religion about Jesus.

One is imitation;
the other, embodiment.

The first builds shrines.
The second builds bridges.

Ask yourself –
do I seek to be right,
or to do right?

The religion of Jesus
does not require belief –
only love made visible.
It does not ask for worship,
but for witness.

Every act of compassion
is a sermon.
Every forgiven hurt,
a gospel verse.

Faith begins where dogma ends –
in the quiet, unrecorded kindness
that turns principle into presence.
