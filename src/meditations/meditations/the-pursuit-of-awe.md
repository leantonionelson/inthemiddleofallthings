Chase wonder —
not success,
not certainty,
not safety.
For wonder is the breath of the soul,
the light that keeps the heart young
even as the body grows old.

To chase wonder
is not to flee the world,
but to meet it as if for the first time —
eyes wide,
heart unclenched,
mind unarmed.

Pause here.
Think of the last time
you were struck silent by beauty —
not because it was grand,
but because it was alive.
A flicker of light on water,
a child's laugh,
the scent of earth after rain.
That was wonder calling.
And you answered,
if only for a moment.

Wonder does not demand explanation.
It dissolves it.
It turns knowledge into reverence
and presence into prayer.
It reminds you that you are not separate
from what astonishes you.

To chase wonder
is to chase remembering —
the recognition that life
is not a puzzle to be solved,
but a miracle to be witnessed.

You will not find wonder
in accumulation,
but in attention.
It does not live in distant galaxies
but in the quiet geometry of this breath,
the warmth of your own hands.

When the world feels grey,
go looking for the shimmer.
Lift your eyes from the screen,
your mind from the noise,
and whisper to the ordinary,
"I know what you are."

Chase wonder,
and it will chase you back.
It will find you in small hours,
in sudden tears,
in the silence between heartbeats,
reminding you that life
was never meant to be understood —
only felt deeply enough
to leave you amazed.
