If I am anything at all,
I am my perception.

Not the image in the mirror,
not the name others use,
but the awareness that perceives
the seeing itself.

The world arises
as I become conscious of it.
The bird does not sing "out there" —
it sings inside my hearing.

Pause here.
Close your eyes.
Notice how reality
continues behind the eyelids,
shaped by imagination and memory.

You are not in the world;
the world is in you.
Every sound, texture, and thought
passes through the gate of perception
to become real.

To refine perception
is to refine existence itself.
The clearer you see,
the truer you become.
