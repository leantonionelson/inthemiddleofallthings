The mind never stops speaking.
It runs ahead,
it loops behind,
it fills the silence with commentary.

But not all voices are true.
Some are echoes of fear.
Some are the weight of expectation.
Some are simply noise—
the restless machine of thought
that confuses movement with meaning.

Quiet the voice in your head.
Not by force,
not by violence.
You do not strangle a voice into silence.
You let it tire.
You let it soften.
You let it fall back into the stillness
that was there before it began.

Breathe.
Notice the words forming.
Do not follow them.
Do not fight them.
Let them pass
like birds crossing the sky—
visible, transient, gone.

The voice will say:
"You should."
"You can't."
"You failed."
Quiet it with presence.
With the weight of now.
With the simple act of being
without reply.

The voice will say:
"You are not enough."
Quiet it by noticing the breath
that has kept you alive
since the moment you began.
Enough to breathe.
Enough to be.

Quiet the voice in your head.
And beneath it,
you will hear another.
Not frantic.
Not demanding.
But steady.
Ancient.
A current of knowing
that does not need words at all.

This is the voice worth listening to.
It speaks not in thought,
but in orientation.
Not in chatter,
but in clarity.

Quiet the voice in your head,
and the world becomes audible again.
The body becomes trustworthy again.
The self becomes spacious again.

You do not need to kill the voice.
You only need to remember—
you are not it.
You are the silence
that remains when it fades.
