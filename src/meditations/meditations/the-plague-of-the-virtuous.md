# The Plague of the Virtuous

The road to hell
is paved with good intentions –
and right now,
we have a plague of virtuous people.

Virtue, when performed,
turns poisonous.
It forgets the heart it came from
and feeds on approval instead.

Think of a time you were right
and knew it.
How quickly righteousness
became armour.
How easily compassion left the room.

True virtue is quiet.
It does not broadcast itself.
It moves in service,
not performance.
It recognises its own fallibility
and bows before complexity.

The loudest moralists
often hide the weakest mirrors.
So before you shout what is right,
look at what your virtue protects you from seeing.

Goodness needs no witness.
It shines through conduct,
not confession.

Let humility be the cure
for this plague of the pure.
