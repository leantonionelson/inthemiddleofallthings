# The Smile You Cannot Measure

You can measure weight and bounce,
map the arc,
calculate the spin,
predict the landing.

You cannot measure the moment
a child laughs.

Emergence is the surplus of meaning
that slips past the instruments.
It is the world remembering it is more
than properties and parts.

Think of a thing you know well –
your craft, your routine, your body.
Recall the instant it surprised you
with joy beyond its function.
That surplus is sacred.

Science is not the enemy of wonder.
It draws the map.
But the laughter is the landscape.
Do both:
know what you can,
and leave a space for the smile
that cannot be graphed.
