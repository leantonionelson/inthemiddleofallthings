Change is the pulse of being.
Movement is life disguised as time.

The more something seems to be permanent,
the more it is already gone.
It no longer shifts,
no longer breathes,
no longer remembers how to become.

What does not move cannot live.
It can endure, yes—
like stone,
like bone,
like the echoes of a name once spoken.
But endurance is not life.
It is the memory of life
held too tightly.

Pause here.
Look at the things you have called permanent—
beliefs, identities, promises carved too deep.
Notice how they have begun to fossilise,
how they resist the flow that made them.

Life does not ask to be fixed.
It asks to be known in motion,
to dissolve and reform,
to breathe its own impermanence.

The more something seems to be permanent,
the more it is lifeless.
Because permanence is the lie of the fearful—
the wish to hold still
what was only ever meant to pass through.

Even stars die.
Even gods change their names.

So loosen your grip.
Let what lives move.
Let what must die, die.
The only permanence worth keeping
is the rhythm that moves through all things—
the endless becoming.
