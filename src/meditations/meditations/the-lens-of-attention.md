# The Lens of Attention

The universe is vast.
Every possibility,
every form,
every unfolding—
all here, all at once.

But you do not live in all of it.
You live in what you see.
What you notice.
What you give your attention to.

Everything exists.
But only where your point of attention rests
does it become real for you.

Pause here.
Feel the breath.
In this moment,
the entire world continues—
storms, laughter, death, birth—
but for you, right now,
reality is this inhale,
this exhale.

Attention is the sculptor of experience.
Place it on fear,
and fear grows.
Place it on beauty,
and beauty expands.
The world is not different—
but your world becomes what you attend to.

This is not illusion.
It is intimacy.
The universe is infinite,
but consciousness makes it personal.
Through you,
the boundless becomes lived.

So ask yourself:
Where is my attention?
What am I choosing to make real today?
What am I breathing into existence
by the simple act of noticing?

Everything exists.
But only where your gaze falls
does it shine into being.
Guard that gaze.
Honour it.
For it is the brush
that paints your reality.
