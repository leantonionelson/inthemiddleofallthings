Blame is easy.
It divides the world into clean lines—
you and I,
right and wrong,
wound and weapon.

But in truth,
we are all both.
Every hand that strikes
was once trembling.
Every heart that closes
was once broken.

No blame.
Treat all with love.

Not because they deserve it,
but because you deserve peace.
Blame corrodes the one who holds it.
It feeds on righteousness
and leaves only ash.

Pause here.
Think of someone who wronged you.
Notice how the story tightens the chest,
how the mind rehearses its defence.
Now breathe,
and imagine the same person
as a frightened child,
lost in their own confusion.
The body softens,
not because the act is excused,
but because understanding
is stronger than judgment.

To treat all with love
is not submission.
It is mastery.
It is seeing clearly
and still choosing to meet the world
without poison in your mouth.

No blame.
The universe is too intricate for fault.
Every motion is a reaction to another,
every cruelty born from its own wound.
You cannot untangle the web with anger.
Only love can dissolve it.

Treat all with love—
not to change them,
but to free yourself
from the illusion of enemies.

Love is not naïve.
It is the only force
that sees the whole
and still forgives it for being complex.
