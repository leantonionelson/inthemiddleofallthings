Family is strength.
To be surrounded by people –
people –
who wish you only goodness
is priceless.

No success compensates
for isolation.
No freedom replaces
the safety of being known.

Picture those who hold you
without condition.
Let their faces rise.
Feel how your spine straightens
in their memory.

Family – by blood or by choice –
is not a possession.
It is a mirror reminding you
that love is reciprocal existence.

To be for one another
is to multiply resilience.
