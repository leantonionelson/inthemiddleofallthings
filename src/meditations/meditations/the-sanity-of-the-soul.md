To fit neatly into a broken system
is not wellness –
it is surrender disguised as success.
When the world grows sick,
health looks like rebellion.

It is no measure of health
to be well adjusted
to a profoundly sick society.

You are not meant to thrive in distortion.
You are meant to remember what whole feels like.
To feel out of place here
is not weakness;
it is evidence of awakening.

Think of all the ways
you've been told to adapt –
to hurry,
to consume,
to numb,
to play roles that preserve the machinery
but starve the soul.
Now ask yourself:
is your discomfort a flaw,
or is it truth speaking through unease?

In a world that has forgotten silence,
your stillness is resistance.
In a culture obsessed with image,
your authenticity is revolution.
When greed is normalised,
your kindness is an act of defiance.

To be well adjusted to sickness
is to inherit its delusion.
To stay sensitive,
to question,
to ache for balance –
these are signs not of fragility,
but of vitality.

The world will ask you to adapt.
Adaptation keeps the machinery running.
But adaptation without awareness
is self-betrayal.
Real health requires dissonance
when the music of society is off key.

You were not born to blend in
with what is dying.
You are here to remember
what life sounds like before the noise.
You are here to remind others
that normal is not the same as natural.

So when you feel estranged,
misfit,
out of sync –
take heart.
That discomfort is your compass
pointing you toward a saner world
you are meant to help restore.

It is no measure of health
to be comfortable in madness.
Better to stand apart,
clear-eyed,
unadjusted,
and alive.
