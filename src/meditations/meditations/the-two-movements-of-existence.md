Matter and light —
two rhythms,
two ways of being in the same universe.

We, the dense ones,
the beings of gravity and form,
move through space and with time.
We are carried forward,
bound to the current.
Every heartbeat a step downstream,
every breath a soft surrender
to the flow of becoming.

But light —
light is free.
It does not travel with time;
it is time unfolded.
For light, there is no before or after,
no memory, no waiting.
It moves through both
as if they were the same.

Pause here.
Feel the weight of your body —
the way gravity holds you close,
reminding you that to be matter
is to belong to the story of change.
Then close your eyes
and imagine being light —
weightless, immediate, everywhere at once.

We travel through space and with time.
We are the slow unfolding of eternity,
the witnessing of the eternal moment
as motion.
But light —
light never leaves the moment.
It never began.
It never ends.
It simply is.

To meditate is to glimpse that state.
To rest so deeply in presence
that the current pauses,
and you, for a moment,
remember what light remembers:
that everything already is.

Matter teaches humility.
Light teaches truth.
We are both —
the embodied and the eternal,
the traveller and the radiance.
Each breath is the meeting point —
half gravity,
half grace.

We move through space and with time,
but sometimes,
when we are very still,
light moves through us.
