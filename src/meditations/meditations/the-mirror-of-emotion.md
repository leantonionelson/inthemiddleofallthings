# The Mirror of Emotion

In emotional moments,
validate before offering perspective.

Truth without tenderness
builds walls.

Remember a time
someone met your pain
with explanation instead of empathy.
Did you hear their words,
or only their distance?

Validation opens the door;
wisdom can enter later.
The heart listens
only once it feels seen.

Understanding without compassion
is noise.
Compassion without understanding
is silence.
Together,
they make music.
