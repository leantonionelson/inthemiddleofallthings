# The Propensity for Violence

I am a large man
with a propensity for violence.

Power is not the danger.
Unconsciousness is.

To know the force within you
is to honour its boundaries.
To deny it
is to let it rule from the dark.

Pause here.
Think of the energy you hide —
anger, desire, will, assertion.
They are not sins.
They are raw materials
for courage and creation.

Strength without awareness
destroys.
Strength with awareness
protects.

Do not suppress the fire.
Learn to tend it.
Violence becomes virtue
when mastered by compassion.
