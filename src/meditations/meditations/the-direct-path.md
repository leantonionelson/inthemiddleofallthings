# The Direct Path

The mind circles.
It analyses, compares, debates.
It builds layers of explanation,
walls of abstraction.
But truth does not live in the circling.
Truth is immediate.

Point directly at it.

Not tomorrow,
not once you've gathered enough words,
not once you've perfected your reasoning.
Now.

What is this breath?
What is this moment?
What is this awareness that sees?

Point directly at it.
Do not describe.
Do not interpret.
Simply notice,
and point.

Pause here.
Where are you?
Not in the story,
not in the past,
not in the plans of your mind.
You are here.
Point directly at the here-ness.
Feel its weight.
Feel its simplicity.

The mind will resist.
It will try to turn pointing into thinking.
It will try to blur the target.
But keep steady.
Direct.
Clear.

This is the discipline of immediacy.
To return again and again
to the essence beneath the narrative.
To the naked fact of being.

Point directly at itâ€”
and you will see there was never a veil.
Only your hesitation to look.

Truth is not far away.
It is not abstract.
It is closer than your own skin.
It is the seeing itself.
The being itself.

Point directly at it.
And you will know
you have always been pointing at yourself.
