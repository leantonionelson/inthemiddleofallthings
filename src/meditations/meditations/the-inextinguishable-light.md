Darkness cannot overcome light.

No matter how vast the shadow,
it cannot swallow
a single spark that chooses to burn.

Close your eyes.
Imagine a small flame
in the centre of your chest.
See how easily
it fills the dark behind your eyelids.

Light is not the absence of darkness;
it is its understanding.
Darkness has no substance –
only space
awaiting illumination.

Keep your own energy.
Shine from within.
The world may dim,
but it cannot extinguish
what you have already lit.
