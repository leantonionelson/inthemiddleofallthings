# The Point of Everything

**Tags:** point, everything, universe, consciousness, awareness, focus, infinite, intimate, significance, recognition

The universe is vast.
Unmeasurable.
Expanding without edge.
Yet here you are—
a single being,
a single point,
carrying all of it within.

You are everything focused on a point.

Every star that has burned
made the atoms in your blood.
Every silence between galaxies
resides in the stillness of your mind.
Every law of physics,
every rhythm of life,
finds expression through you.

Pause here.
Close your eyes.
Feel the body sitting,
breathing.
It feels small.
And yet—
it is composed of everything.
The breath is not yours alone.
It belongs to the trees,
to the oceans,
to the first spark that set all motion in play.

You are everything focused on a point.
And that point is consciousness.
Awareness.
The lens through which the infinite
becomes intimate.

When you feel insignificant,
remember this truth.
Your being is not separate from the whole.
It is the whole,
condensed,
intensified,
made visible in form.

A point is not less than a line,
less than a circle,
less than a sphere.
It is the beginning of all of them.

You are everything focused on a point.
And in that point,
the universe recognises itself.
