Not every frown is fury.
Not every clenched jaw is threat.
Sometimes the face that looks hardest
is the one holding itself together.

Of course I look angry all the time —
my life is soaked in pain.
But the truth is,
I'm not angry;
I'm trying to be happy.

Pain distorts expression.
Joy, when forced through scars,
can look like defiance.
Hope, when wrestled from despair,
can sound like rage.

Pause here.
Think of a time your tenderness
was mistaken for sharpness.
A time your silence
was read as pride.
That misunderstanding is the cost
of surviving without explanation.

When life teaches you to protect the wound,
you learn to wear armour even while healing.
You smile from within it,
but the world only sees the metal.

Still, you keep trying —
not to appear kind,
but to stay alive.
Not to convince them,
but to convince yourself
that beneath the weight of pain,
light still waits.

This is what they don't see:
that every heavy face
is also a prayer for relief.
That every guarded look
is a plea to be recognised,
not for the anger,
but for the effort.

So when you meet the hardened,
look again.
Behind the scowl
may live the gentlest heart,
still fighting to find its smile.

And when you see it in yourself,
forgive it.
The world taught you to survive loudly,
but happiness can grow in silence too.

You are not angry.
You are becoming free.
