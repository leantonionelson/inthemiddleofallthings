The religion of Jesus
and the religion about Jesus
are two different things.

One invites transformation.
The other demands allegiance.

One is the living breath of love;
the other, its portrait framed in dogma.

Feel the difference between following a path
and defending a wall.
One moves,
the other freezes.

To follow the religion of Jesus
is to live as he lived –
to see the divine in the ordinary,
to lift others without hierarchy,
to embody truth
rather than worship the idea of it.

The religion about Jesus
builds altars.
The religion of Jesus
becomes one.
