Everything vibrates.
Matter.
Emotion.
Thought.
Even silence has its hum.

You are no exception.
You carry a frequency—
a rhythm that is uniquely yours.
Not higher, not lower.
Simply distinct.
An expression of the energy you are.

But the world is noisy.
Other frequencies crowd in.
Some harmonise,
drawing you deeper into yourself.
Others distort,
pulling you off-centre,
leaving you resonating with tones
that are not your own.

Keep your own frequency.
This is not about resistance.
It is about coherence.
Remaining tuned to the pitch of your being
even when the air around you wavers.

Pause now.
Feel into your body.
Notice the subtle hum beneath thought.
It is there—
in the breath,
in the blood,
in the warmth of your skin.
That is your frequency.

When you compromise too far,
you feel it immediately.
A heaviness.
A static.
A sense that you are moving
out of rhythm with yourself.
This is the body telling you:
retune.

Keep your own frequency.
Not by isolation,
but by alignment.
When you enter a room,
let others feel your tone,
instead of losing yourself in theirs.
When you speak,
let the words carry resonance,
not imitation.

Ask yourself:
What am I tuned to right now?
Does it echo my truth,
or does it drown it out?
What practices bring me back
to my own signal?

Keep your own frequency.
Because when you do,
the world doesn't just hear you—
it hears itself more clearly through you.
Harmony comes not from sameness,
but from each note sounding true.

You are not meant to disappear
into the noise.
You are meant to hold your tone
until it becomes music.
