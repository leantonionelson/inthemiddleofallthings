# The Isness of Life

The mind wants complexity.
It builds meanings,
layers upon layers,
until life feels heavy with explanation.

But beneath all of it,
life is simple.
It does not need to justify itself.
It does not require a reason to be.

Life simply is.

The tree does not argue its purpose.
The river does not explain its direction.
The star does not apologise for burning.
They are.
That is enough.

Pause here.
Notice your breath.
You are breathing not because you earned it,
not because you solved it,
but because life breathes you.
Even in silence,
even in stillness,
life continues.

We suffer when we demand that life
be something other than what it is.
When we insist it must answer to our desire.
But life will not bend to our questions.
It will only keep being.

To see this is not despair.
It is freedom.
Because if life simply is,
you do not need to fight it.
You only need to live it.
Not as a puzzle,
but as presence.

Life is not against you.
It is not for you either.
It is itself.
And in its isness,
you find your own.

Life simply is.
And that is the most profound giftâ€”
to exist without condition,
to be here,
now,
in the vast simplicity of being.
