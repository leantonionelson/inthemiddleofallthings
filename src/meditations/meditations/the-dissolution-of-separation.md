Heaven is not above.
It is within—
the place where division ends,
where the edges between self and world
melt like dawn into light.

Heaven is where you go
when the thing that separates you from all existence dies.
That "thing" is not the body.
It is the thought of "I" and "they,"
the ancient wound of distance,
the illusion that love must discriminate
to be pure.

Pause here.
Feel where separation lives in you.
Perhaps in the chest,
the tightening of the heart
when faced with difference.
Perhaps in the mind,
where judgement disguises itself as certainty.
Breathe into that space.
Each breath loosens the boundary.
Each exhale releases a wall.

When you begin to feel for all beings
what you once reserved for your own,
you enter heaven.
Not after death,
but within life.
Not through gates,
but through recognition.

Heaven is not a place of reward.
It is a state of realisation.
It is the return to unity—
the awareness that the light in your eyes
is the same light that burns in all others.

When separation dies,
love becomes gravity.
It holds everything together.
It does not ask who deserves it.
It simply is.

Heaven begins the moment
you stop guarding the borders of your heart.
When you love without preference,
when your joy expands beyond your name,
when you finally see yourself
in everything that breathes.

Heaven is not a destination.
It is remembrance.
And the only death it requires
is the death of the illusion
that you were ever alone.
