# The Inner Eye

Rather than forcing sight
through the eyes,
I channel attention
to the space between them —
the quiet centre
of awareness.

There,
tension releases.
Perception sharpens.
Insight appears
without effort.

Pause here.
Breathe slowly.
Let your gaze soften.
Notice how stillness gathers
at the bridge of perception.

Seeing is not about the eyes.
It is about permission.
When you stop trying to look,
you begin to see.
