The present moment hides nothing.
It holds everything —
quietly, patiently,
like a hand waiting to be opened.
But we rush past it,
chasing futures that never come
and replaying pasts that never return.

The present moment is filled with joy and happiness.
If you are attentive, you will see it.

Joy is not absent;
it is overlooked.
It hides in plain sight —
in the rhythm of your breath,
the warmth of sunlight on your face,
the ordinary pulse of life that continues
even when you forget to notice.

Pause here.
Look around you, slowly.
Without naming or judging,
let your senses awaken.
The colours, the sounds,
the texture of the air.
This — just this —
is enough.

Attention is love's first act.
It is how the world knows it has been seen.
And in being seen,
it blooms.
What we call joy
is not something we create —
it is what life reveals
when we finally stop looking elsewhere.

Happiness is not hidden in special moments;
it is woven into all moments.
It does not depend on condition,
but on perception.
To be attentive
is to return to the miracle
that has been unfolding all along.

The now is generous.
It gives endlessly.
But it requires your presence
to be known.

The present moment is filled with joy and happiness.
Not the loud kind,
not the spectacular kind,
but the quiet, eternal kind —
the joy of simply being here,
breathing,
alive,
aware.

Look closely.
This is it.
This has always been it.
