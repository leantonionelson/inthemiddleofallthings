A life of good deeds
is better than a life of good faith.

Belief is easy.
It asks only your agreement.
Action asks your presence.

The world has no shortage of believers —
those who speak of light
but do not carry it.
Goodness is not conviction;
it is conduct.

Pause here.
Think of the moments when you were kind
without being asked,
when no one would ever know.
That was faith incarnate —
belief translated into being.

Good deeds are how the invisible becomes real.
They are how heaven borrows our hands.
Faith, left alone, can rot into pride,
but action humbles belief
by testing it in the dust of the earth.

Do good quietly.
Let the echo, not the claim, define you.
In the end,
deeds outlive doctrine.
They are the prayer answered
as it is spoken.
