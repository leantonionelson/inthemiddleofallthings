# Perspective and Time

Life is not fixed.
It bends with the angle you choose to see it from,
and it stretches or contracts
with the measure of time you apply.

Perspective gives it shape.
Time gives it rhythm.
Together, they weave the story you call living.

From one perspective,
a challenge is an obstacle.
From another,
it is instruction.
From another still,
it is already gone.

From one measure of time,
life is short,
a flicker against eternity.
From another,
it is vast,
a horizon so wide
that each breath becomes a world.

Pause here.
Look at your own life.
Notice how different it feels
depending on the lens you wear.
The same day,
the same events,
but seen from another angle,
become entirely new.

Life is not what happens.
It is how it is held
in perspective and time.
Shift either,
and reality shifts with it.

This is not illusion.
It is freedom.
For if life can change by the angle you take
and the time you hold it within,
then you are never trapped.
You can always step back,
lean closer,
slow down,
or let go.

Life is just how we define perspective and time.
And wisdom is the art of choosing both with care.
