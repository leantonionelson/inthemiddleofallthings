---

I am not the scanner
and I the scanning.
In that moment,
I am my very perspective
of the universe itself.

The act of seeing
and the seen
are one.

Feel yourself watching this sentence.
Who is watching?
Where does the watcher end
and the watched begin?

Awareness folds inward.
Observation reveals identity.
You are not behind perception;
you are its living surface.

The universe witnesses itself
through your eyes,
and when you look long enough,
you realise –
you were never looking at anything.
You were looking as it.
