# Fear's Reflection

Fear is only useful
in a threatening world —
but the world is only threatening
because of fear.

Perception and projection
dance in a circle.
The fear you see outside
is often the fear unacknowledged within.

Pause here.
Notice the thing you call dangerous.
What part of you
does it mirror?

To dissolve fear
is not to conquer it,
but to understand its reflection.
Safety begins
when the inner war quiets.

Fear can alert,
but not lead.
Use it as signal,
not compass.
For when you see through it,
the world softens —
and so do you.
