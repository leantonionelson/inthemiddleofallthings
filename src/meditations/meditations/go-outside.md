Go outside.
Let the sky edit your name.

When you step into open space,
the self loosens its belt.
Your sense of I
spreads to the horizon,
then past it,
through memory and imagination,
until what you call me
feels more like a field than a point.

I sometimes see myself in the third person,
a moving bubble of attention,
sphere of influence radiating from a centre.
As above, so below.

Pause here.
Notice your room shaping your thoughts.
Now step to a window,
or into air if you can.
Feel the boundary of self
push outward with each breath.
Let the world in
until you remember you were never apart.

Perspective is not only optical.
It is emotional and mental,
the widening that makes space
for another's weather,
another's story.

Go outside,
not to escape yourself,
but to find the version of you
big enough to include everything
you were resisting.
