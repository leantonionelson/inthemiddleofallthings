# The Field of Attention

Existence is wide,
but awareness is narrow.
Everything may be present,
but only what is attended to
is alive in you.

Or everything can exist,
but only exists where there is attention.

Pause here.
Close your eyes.
Notice the sounds beyond you—
a car, a bird, the hum of silence itself.
Were they not there a moment ago?
They were.
But only now,
because you placed your attention there,
do they exist for you.

This is the secret of creation.
Attention is not passive.
It is generative.
It does not merely observe reality—
it summons it.

The tree in the forest,
the star beyond sight,
the stranger's joy on another continent—
they exist.
But for you,
they awaken only when attention arrives.

So life is not just about what exists.
It is about where you direct the beam.
Scatter it,
and the world fragments.
Focus it,
and the world takes shape.

Or everything can exist,
but only exists where there is attention.
This means you are not trapped.
You can always move the gaze.
From pain to learning.
From fear to presence.
From despair to wonder.

The field is endless.
But your attention is the hand
that chooses where the light will fall.

Guard it well.
For in choosing where to look,
you choose the world you live in.
