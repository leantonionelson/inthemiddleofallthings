# The Default of Love

Not every moment asks for brilliance.
Not every encounter asks for power.
But every moment, every encounter,
asks for love.

To approach with love
is not sentiment.
It is orientation.
A way of standing before life
with the heart unshielded,
with the hand unclenched.

Make love be your default.
Not because the world is always kind.
Not because people always deserve it.
But because love keeps you aligned
with what you are.

Pause here.
Think of the moments when you met life without love.
The sharp words,
the withheld compassion,
the armour you wore.
Did those moments strengthen you,
or did they close you in?

Now think of the moments you gave love,
even when it was difficult.
Notice how the body remembers them differently—
lighter, freer, more expansive.

Approach everything with love.
The task before you.
The stranger beside you.
The failure behind you.
The uncertainty ahead.
Not all will return love to you,
but all will be transformed by its presence.

Love is not naïve.
It sees clearly.
It knows the fractures of the world.
And still it chooses to meet them
not with fear,
not with anger,
but with openness.

Make love be your default.
For when you forget,
you fall into contraction.
And when you remember,
you return to yourself.

You cannot control what life brings.
But you can control how you greet it.
And love, always,
is the truest greeting.
