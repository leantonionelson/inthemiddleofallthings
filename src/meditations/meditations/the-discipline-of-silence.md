# The Discipline of Silence

**Tags:** patience, discernment, peace, humility, restraint, mindfulness, wisdom, speech, equanimity

---

Refrain from complaint
if the offence
holds no consequence.

Not every irritation
deserves a monument of words.
Energy follows attention;
choose where to invest.

Recall the last small annoyance
that stole your calm.
Did it warrant the rent
it paid in your mind?

Silence is not weakness.
It is precision.
Reserve your voice
for what shapes meaning.
Let the rest dissolve
into unspoken grace.
