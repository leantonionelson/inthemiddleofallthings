There are many ways to reach the summit,
but the view is only a glimpse.
You cannot live there.
The air is too thin.

We enjoy getting high—
lifting beyond ourselves,
beyond weight and wound,
tasting unity.
But eventually the taste fades,
and we crave not the experience,
but the state itself.
We want to be high.

Yet the path of elevation is not escape.
It is revelation.
What you see up there
is not meant to replace life below,
but to remind you
of what was always within it.

Pause here.
Remember a time you felt expanded—
through love, art, nature, or medicine.
Remember the stillness, the awe.
Now, ask:
Was it the substance or the seeing?
Was it the climb or the clarity?

Psychedelics, devotion, discipline—
they open doors.
But they do not walk you through them.
They are the spark, not the fire.
The transformation must come
from the labour of integration,
from the slow descent back into the ordinary
with eyes that now see differently.

We enjoy getting high
until getting high is not enough.
Because truth is not in the height.
It is in the grounding that follows,
the embodiment of the light glimpsed above.

You cannot stay on the peak.
You were made for the valley—
to bring heaven down into the soil,
to make divinity useful,
human,
real.

The journey upward is easy.
The return is sacred.
For there you learn
that enlightenment was never distance—
it was depth.
