Don't run from your demons.
Learn their names.

Fear thrives in anonymity.
Once named,
it becomes part of your vocabulary –
something you can speak with
instead of flee from.

Close your eyes.
Call to mind the emotion you avoid most –
anger, shame, envy, grief.
Whisper its name.
Notice how the moment you name it,
it stops being a monster
and starts being a messenger.

Demons are not banished by denial.
They dissolve through dialogue.
Each one guards a locked door
to a room of power.

The key is recognition.
Say to it:
"I see you. You may walk beside me,
but you no longer lead."

Light does not fight darkness;
it defines it.
To know your demons
is to inherit your wings.
