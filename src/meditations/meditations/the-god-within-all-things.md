# The God Within All Things

God is existence.
We are expressions of it.

To live well
is to live in awareness of that unity.
See the god in all things
and you will live closer
to a full life.

Pause here.
Look around you —
not with your eyes,
but with your understanding.
Each object,
each person,
each breath
is the same divinity
in different disguise.

When you recognise this,
judgement softens,
and love becomes inevitable.

The world does not need saving.
It needs seeing.
