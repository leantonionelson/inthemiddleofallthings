You walk through a hall of mirrors.
Every face you meet reflects a part of you back—
not who you are,
but who they need you to be.

Some see kindness and soften.
Some see threat and harden.
Some see only themselves,
and never truly see you at all.

It becomes difficult to engage with the world with peace
when the eyes that meet yours
do not meet you,
but their own reflection.

Pause here.
Think of how often you have been misread—
your calm mistaken for coldness,
your silence mistaken for judgement,
your strength mistaken for pride.
Notice how easily peace bends
under the weight of projection.

The world does not see you as you are.
It sees itself through you.
And not everyone is peaceful.

So your work is not to correct every mirror.
It is to remember which reflection is yours.
It is to know your own stillness so deeply
that even when the glass distorts,
you remain clear within.

When others are at war with themselves,
they will try to conscript you.
Do not enlist.
Stand in your peace
as a quiet defiance.

You cannot stop the world from reflecting.
But you can stop mistaking the reflection for truth.
Peace does not depend on how you are seen,
but on how you continue to see.

You are the light,
not the mirror.
And the light remains pure,
no matter how fractured the surface it meets.
