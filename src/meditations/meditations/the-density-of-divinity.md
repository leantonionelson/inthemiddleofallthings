# The Density of Divinity

The universe is not elsewhere.
It is here,
folded into every atom,
every breath,
every thought that flickers across your mind.

It is inevitable.
How could it not be?
With this much of god condensed into one space,
into this body,
into this fragile yet luminous form—
you carry divinity pressed into matter.

Pause here.
Touch your chest.
Feel the pulse beneath your hand.
That rhythm is older than you.
Older than humanity.
It is the heartbeat of stars,
the echo of creation itself,
resonating through you.

We imagine god as distant.
But god is density.
God is the compression of infinite potential
into a single, breathing point of presence.
And that point is you.

This does not mean you control all.
It means you contain all.
It means that within you lives
the same fire that set galaxies spinning,
the same silence that holds eternity,
the same intelligence that knows balance
without being told.

It is inevitable.
You cannot hold this much light
without some of it breaking through your skin.
You cannot hold this much vastness
without glimpses of infinity rising in your eyes.

Do not shrink from this.
Do not pretend you are less.
You are not god in entirety.
But you are god in expression.
And that is enough.

It is inevitable.
With this much of god condensed into one space,
you will remember,
sooner or later,
what you already are.
