There is a place within you
that does not move with time.
A still centre
beneath the shifting weather of thought,
beneath the noise of striving and sorrow.
Your sacred space is there –
the inner hearth where the flame never dies.

Your sacred space is where you can find yourself
again and again.
Not a physical room,
but a state of remembering.
A returning.
A quiet doorway back to being.

Close your eyes and ask:
"Where do I go when I come home to myself?"
It may be the breath.
It may be the silence before sleep.
It may be the soft moment
between one heartbeat and the next.
That is your sanctuary.
You have always carried it.

The world will pull you outward –
into plans, into personas,
into the endless mirrors of expectation.
You will lose your centre a thousand times.
That is not failure.
It is the rhythm of forgetting and return.

But every return deepens the knowing.
Each time you find yourself again,
you rediscover that peace was never absent,
only unattended.

Your sacred space is not about escape.
It is where life touches you most intimately –
where you stop performing long enough
to feel the pulse of truth beneath all identity.

Go there often.
Sit with the silence
until it starts speaking again.
Let the noise of the day settle
until the water clears.
And when you rise,
carry a little of that stillness with you
into the movement of the world.

Your sacred space is not a retreat.
It is a re-entry point
into wholeness.
It is where you remember
that no matter how far you drift,
the way back
was always inside.
