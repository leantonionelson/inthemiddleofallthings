# The Weight of Freedom

Freedom feels like a gift.
Choice feels like power.
But with every choice comes consequence,
and with every freedom comes weight.

Free will is a curse it seems.
Because it is limitless.
It allows us not only to create,
but to interfere.
Not only to nurture,
but to destroy.

We interrupt the rhythm of nature.
We meddle with what once balanced itself.
We imagine we know best,
and often we do not.

Pause here.
Think of the times your choices,
even with good intent,
pulled you away from harmony.
Notice how easily free will becomes compulsion,
how quickly freedom becomes burden.

Yet this is the paradox:
free will is curse,
but also opportunity.
It is the chance to align yourself consciously
with the greater flow.
To choose not interference,
but reverence.
Not disruption,
but harmony.

Free will is the fire.
You can burn the forest,
or you can warm the village.
The fire is the same.
The outcome is not.

Do not despise the curse.
Learn to carry it.
Learn to turn freedom into service,
choice into care,
will into wisdom.

Free will is dangerous.
But it is also divine.
And in learning how to wield it,
you learn how to live as part of the whole,
instead of in defiance of it.
