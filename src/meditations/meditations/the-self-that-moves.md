The world never pauses.
Even silence shifts.
Even the mountains tilt by inches while no one looks.
And yet we cling –
to names, to shapes, to the illusion of a fixed "I."

But what you call you
was never a statue.
It was always a flame.

In this changing world,
to define yourself too rigidly
is to mistake the candle for the fire.
When the wax melts,
you grieve what was never meant to last.

Ask yourself:
Who am I today?
Notice how the answer changes
even before you finish the question.
That is not instability.
That is truth.

The self is not lost in change.
It is change.
A wave cannot exist without motion;
neither can you.
You are not the identity –
you are the act of becoming it.

Define yourself as the thing that is changing.
Then you can never fall out of step with the world.
You will age without bitterness.
You will evolve without fear.
You will belong to the same rhythm
that turns stars to dust
and dust to stars again.

To cling is to fracture.
To flow is to remember.
You are not being carried by change –
you are what carries it.

The moment you stop resisting,
you return to the truth:
you were never a solid thing.
You were the movement itself.
