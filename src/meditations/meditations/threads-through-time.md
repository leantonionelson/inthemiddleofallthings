# Threads Through Time

The self is not fixed.
It is not only who you are now.
You are stretched—
a thread running through memory and possibility,
woven across the fabric of time.

We are quantumly connected
to our past and future self.
What you do now
echoes backward as healing,
forward as becoming.
Every choice vibrates across the whole thread.

Pause here.
Close your eyes.
Picture your younger self.
The child, the adolescent,
the one who carried wounds,
who asked questions you now answer.
Breathe love into that image.
Your breath now travels back to them,
a comfort, a reassurance.

Now picture your future self.
Older.
Perhaps wiser.
Carrying the fruits of choices you make today.
Breathe again.
Send them strength,
so that they may look back with gratitude.

We imagine time as straight,
but it is not.
It loops,
it folds,
it allows dialogue across eras of the self.
You are speaking to your past even now.
You are answering your future already.

We are quantumly connected
to our past and future self.
Which means you are never alone.
The child within walks with you.
The elder within waits for you.
And both are shaped
by the orientation you take in this moment.

So breathe.
Honour the thread.
Be gentle with the self that was,
be faithful to the self that will be.
For all of them—past, present, future—
are you,
together,
now.
