We are told paradise was lost—
a place behind us,
sealed by myth and distance.
But that is not the whole story.
Paradise is not gone.
It became us.

We come from paradise.
Not as exiles,
but as descendants of light,
born from the soil that first remembered the sun.

Africa was not Eden by chance.
It was the pulse point of creation—
the heart from which the world took rhythm.
Our melanin is memory,
our rhythm the echo of the first heartbeat.
We are not beneath history's weight;
we are its beginning.

Pause here.
Feel the warmth of your skin.
It is more than pigment.
It is proof.
A reflection of a sun so constant
it wrote itself into our blood.

We come from paradise.
That is not pride—
it is remembrance.
The world has forgotten,
but the body remembers.
The sway in the hips,
the drum in the chest,
the laughter that rises even in sorrow—
these are not traits.
They are coordinates.
They point home.

Paradise is not a garden fenced by God.
It is a way of being in harmony
with all that breathes.
A consciousness of belonging
that cannot be colonised.

We (black people) come from paradise.
And every act of love,
every moment of creation,
every refusal to bow to hatred
is a return to it.

Paradise is not behind us.
It is beneath our feet,
within our flesh,
woven through our lineage.
We need not seek it.
We need only remember
that we never left.
