Knowledge is easy.
Wisdom is earned.
Anyone can repeat the right answer —
but to know why it is right
requires the courage to think,
to feel,
to see beneath the surface of truth.

Knowing the right answer
is imitation.
Knowing why
is integration.
The first memorises.
The second understands.

Pause here.
Think of the truths you hold most tightly.
Do you know them,
or do you know why you know them?
Did you inherit them
from someone else's certainty,
or carve them from the raw stone of experience?

Answers without understanding
build fragile foundations.
They collapse under pressure,
because they were never lived —
only learned.

To know why
is to have walked through the fire of doubt
and come out clearer,
not cleaner.
It means you've tested the truth,
and found it still standing.

The mind that only collects answers
grows heavy,
cluttered with the knowledge of others.
The mind that seeks to understand
remains light,
curious,
alive.

The right answer can be recited by anyone.
But why requires intimacy —
with the question,
with the struggle,
with yourself.
It asks you to stand in uncertainty long enough
for real knowing to emerge.

So do not rush to be correct.
Be sincere.
Do not cling to truth as possession;
explore it as relationship.

Knowing the right answer
makes you informed.
Knowing why
makes you wise.
