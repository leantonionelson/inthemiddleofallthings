Noise is the veil that keeps us from the divine.
It fills the space between thought and awareness
so completely that truth has no place to enter.
We mistake sound for living,
movement for meaning,
and in doing so,
we drown the whisper of being itself.

The quieter you become,
the more you can hear.

Because silence is not absence –
it is presence in its purest form.
It is the voice before words,
the song before sound,
the vibration of the universe before creation unfolded.

When you still yourself,
the world does not fall silent –
it begins to speak.
The wind resumes its ancient language,
the pulse beneath your skin becomes audible,
and the spaces between moments
start to hum with awareness.

Let your breath slow.
Feel how sound begins to dissolve into stillness.
Even thought begins to quiet
when it realises it is being watched.
That watcher –
that vast, listening presence –
is you.

You do not gain new senses through quiet;
you uncover the ones you forgot.
The subtle frequencies of life
are always transmitting.
It is your stillness that tunes you in.

Silence is not a void.
It is a medium –
the space through which the eternal communicates.
You hear more not because there is more to hear,
but because you have finally stopped interrupting.

In stillness,
you hear the truth of things:
that the world is not outside you,
but within you.
That all sound arises from the same field
that you call self.

The quieter you become,
the more you can hear –
not just the world,
but the vastness from which the world speaks.
And if you listen deeply enough,
you will realise
it has always been saying the same thing:
You are home. You are whole. You are me.
