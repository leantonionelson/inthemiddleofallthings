# The Body as Temple

Spiritual goals
are only obtained
through physical development.

The soul does not float above the body —
it grows through it.
Every revelation has a pulse.
Every awakening, a heartbeat.

The body is the altar
where awareness lights its flame.
Without it,
spirit has no instrument to sing through.

Pause here.
Feel your breath filling the ribs,
your weight pressed into the ground.
This is not distraction —
it is devotion.

Stretch, sweat, breathe, rest.
Each motion polishes the vessel.
Each act of care
aligns heaven with earth.

You do not transcend the body
to reach the divine.
You descend into it,
until spirit recognises its reflection
in muscle, bone, and breath.
