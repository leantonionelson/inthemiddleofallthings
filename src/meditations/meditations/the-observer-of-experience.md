# The Observer of Experience

You are not the thought
or the feeling.
If you are anything at all,
you are the experience.

Thoughts come and go,
feelings rise and fade –
but the awareness that sees them
remains unchanged.

Notice what you are feeling right now.
Now notice
that you are not that feeling –
you are the one noticing it.

This is freedom:
to rest as the observer,
not the storm.

When you stop clinging
to what passes through you,
you discover
the vastness that holds it all.

You are the space,
not the weather.
Be the sky –
let the clouds move as they must.
