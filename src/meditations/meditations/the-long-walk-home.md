We are not travellers in a foreign land.
We are fragments of the same whole
moving through time,
each step a soft return
to where we came from.

We're all just walking each other home.

Home is not a house,
nor heaven.
It is the point of origin –
the unity before separation,
the silence before sound,
the light before form.
To live is to wander from that source;
to love is to remember the way back.

Every meeting is part of the return.
Each soul you encounter
is a mirror from the same light,
momentarily shaped into a different face.
When you help another rise,
you rise too –
because there is no "other."
The hand that reaches
and the hand that is held
belong to the same being.

Feel the breath that moves through you.
It was once inside another –
tree, ancestor, stranger, star.
We share this air,
as we share this journey.

We walk together
toward dissolution,
toward reunion.
Mortality is not the end –
it is the merging.
The return to undivided awareness,
the shedding of form
that once made us forget our connection.

So we walk –
not as strangers,
but as sparks of the same fire
finding their way back to the flame.

We walk through love,
through loss,
through memory,
through forgetting.
And in the end,
we will stand where we began –
as light,
as one,
as home.

We are not here to escape mortality.
We are here to walk it with grace,
together –
each step a farewell,
each step a homecoming.

We're all just walking each other home.
