# The Divine Split

---

The universe exists
as a consequence of duality.

God, in a sense,
split Himself
into before and after –
and all that we know
was born in that division.

Every opposite
is a fragment of the divine dialogue.
Light speaks to dark,
order to chaos,
silence to sound.

Think of a paradox within yourself –
love and anger,
hope and fear,
rest and restlessness.
Both are sacred.
Both necessary.

Without contrast,
there is no awareness.
Without division,
no creation.

Duality is not exile from God –
it is God discovering Himself
in two directions at once.

And between them,
we live –
as the meeting point
of infinity exploring itself.
