Love begins as projection.
We meet another
and cast light upon them –
a reflection of our longing,
our ideal,
our unfinished story.
We fall for the image,
not the being.

But that is not love.
That is desire in disguise –
a wish for completion dressed as devotion.

See her as she is,
not as you want her to be.
Then fall in love with that.

To love truly is to shift orientation –
from grasping to witnessing,
from possession to presence.
It is to release the fantasy
and meet the real,
to let the soul of another
remain unedited by your dream.

Think of the person you love,
or once did.
Notice the subtle pull
to adjust them in your mind –
to soften their edges,
to amplify their light.
Now, strip away the projection.
See what remains.
The human – whole, flawed, alive.
That is where love begins.

Love requires orientation.
It is not blind.
It is clear seeing.
It faces truth and chooses it anyway.
To orient yourself toward love
is to face another's reality
without flinching,
to recognise the raw geometry of their being
and still say, Yes.

This is why love is sacred:
because it mirrors enlightenment.
Both demand surrender of illusion.
Both dissolve the barrier
between what is wanted
and what is.

See her as she is,
not as you want her to be.
Fall in love with that –
not to cage her,
but to free yourself.
For when you love what is,
you stop confusing attachment for care,
and desire becomes reverence.

Love requires orientation.
Not forward, not back,
but toward truth.
Face it fully.
It is there that love finally sees itself.
