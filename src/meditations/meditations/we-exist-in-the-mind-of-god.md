# We Exist in the Mind of God

We exist solely
and completely
in the mind of God.

Everything we call reality —
matter, thought, time, self —
is the dreaming of an infinite awareness.
And we are the dream
wondering at itself.

Pause here.
Feel the air on your skin.
Notice how perception
happens inside you.
Now imagine the same awareness
within which galaxies arise.
Different only in scale,
not in kind.

To exist in the mind of God
is not to be small,
but sacred.
You are not outside divinity,
you are its expression.

When you speak,
God learns a new sound.
When you love,
the universe remembers its purpose.
When you fall silent,
awareness rests within itself.

We are the thoughts of God,
and the moment we awaken
to that knowing,
we become co-authors
of the dream.
