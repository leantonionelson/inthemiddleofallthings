Center is not a place.
It is a return.

When the world spins too fast,
when the voices grow too loud,
when the demands pull you
in every directionâ€”
center calls you home.

Not to a place of perfect calm,
but to the place where you remember
who you are beneath
all the noise.

Close your eyes.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Feel your breath moving
without your permission.
Feel your heart beating
its steady rhythm.

This is center.
Not the absence of chaos,
but your presence within it.

Center is knowing
that you can bend without breaking,
that you can be moved
without being moved off course.

It is the difference between
reacting and responding,
between being swept away
and choosing your direction.

When you find center,
you find your true north.
Not a destination,
but a way of navigating
that honors both
where you are
and where you're going.

Return here often.
This place knows you.
This place waits for you.
This place is you.
