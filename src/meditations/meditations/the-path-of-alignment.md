Bliss is not indulgence.
It is alignment —
the resonance between your deepest truth
and the movement of existence itself.

When you follow your bliss,
you are not chasing pleasure;
you are listening to the quiet compass
of the soul,
pointing toward the direction
where life recognises itself through you.

Follow your bliss
and the universe will open doors
where there were only walls.
Because the universe does not resist
what is in harmony with it.
It flows toward coherence,
toward the song that sounds like its own.

Pause here.
Think of a time you did what you loved
without asking permission,
without calculating gain.
Do you remember how easily
things seemed to fall into place?
That was not coincidence —
that was resonance.
The pattern of reality
rearranging itself
around your authenticity.

The walls we see
are often the limits of our imagination,
not the boundaries of possibility.
Bliss erases them
not by force,
but by redefinition.
What once looked like obstruction
becomes initiation.
What once seemed locked
reveals its hinge.

Following your bliss
requires trust —
to step toward joy
even when reason hesitates.
To believe that what lights your spirit
is not selfish,
but sacred.

Bliss is not a path you find;
it is a path that forms beneath your feet
when you walk in truth.
And the universe, recognising its reflection,
rushes to meet you halfway.

So listen closely.
Your bliss is not a luxury.
It is a signal —
a frequency tuned to your role
in the grand harmony of existence.

Follow it,
and the world unfolds to meet you.
Ignore it,
and the walls will remain walls.

The choice is not between risk and safety —
it is between aliveness and inertia.
Between living as an echo,
or becoming the sound itself.
