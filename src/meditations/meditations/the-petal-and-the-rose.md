# The Petal and the Rose

**Tags:** unity, self, divinity, belonging, wholeness, nature, consciousness, love, creation

---

I am the universe,
as much as the petal is the rose.

Identity is not separation,
but expression.
The petal may fall,
but the rose remains whole.

Touch your hand to your chest.
Feel the life there –
the same pulse
that moves oceans,
the same rhythm
that spins galaxies.

You are not in the universe.
You are the universe,
experiencing itself
in human form.

To see this
is to fall in love
with everything.
