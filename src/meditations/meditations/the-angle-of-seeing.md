Wisdom does not arrive in answers.
It arrives in angles.
How you look,
from where you look,
determines what you see.

Perspective is the hidden teacher.
Shift a step to the left,
and the same truth appears new.
Shift a step inward,
and the same pain reveals its lesson.
Shift a step upward,
and the same life becomes a pattern,
not an accident.

Perspective is how we gain wisdom.
Not through accumulation,
but through reorientation.
Not more facts,
but more vantage points.

Pause here.
Think of a moment in your past
that still unsettles you.
Now tilt it.
See it not as wound,
but as training.
Not as punishment,
but as passage.
Does it feel different?
Do you feel different?

Wisdom is not the erasure of suffering.
It is the widening of sight
until suffering takes its place within the whole.

This is why elders carry gravity.
Not because they know more,
but because they have stood at more angles,
looked through more layers,
seen the same river from the mountain
and the valley.

Perspective is not distance.
It is intimacy multiplied.
Each new angle softens certainty,
dissolves arrogance,
opens space for compassion.

Perspective is how we gain wisdom.
And wisdom is not the possession of truth.
It is the practice of turning the prism,
again and again,
until the light reveals what it always was.
