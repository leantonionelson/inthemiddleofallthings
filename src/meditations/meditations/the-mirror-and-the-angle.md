Reality does not sit apart,
watching you from some fixed throne.
It bends, responds, adjusts –
a vast mirror shaped by the light of your perception.

Reality is both a reflection of you
and reflecting on you.
It does not only echo what you are;
it studies you.
It listens to the tone of your thoughts,
the posture of your energy,
and returns them as circumstance.

Every moment is feedback –
the universe whispering,
"This is how you are looking at me."

Consider the reflections you meet daily –
in people, in work, in quiet moments of solitude.
What do they show?
Are they kind?
Harsh?
Silent?
Each is an angle of yourself
thrown outward into form.

If you change the angle,
the reflection changes with it.
Tilt your heart toward gratitude,
and the world glows warmer.
Lean toward fear,
and the glass clouds.

The universe is not moral,
but responsive.
It organises itself around your orientation.
Not as punishment or reward,
but as resonance.
You receive the frequency you emit.

Reality reflects you –
and at the same time,
it reflects on you,
guiding, testing, refining,
showing you what still needs to be seen.

Angling that reflection to the positive
is not denial of pain.
It is mastery of perspective.
It is the art of holding truth in light.

So when life mirrors back struggle,
do not smash the glass.
Adjust your stance.
Soften your gaze.
Remember that the reflection follows the seer.

Reality will always look like you –
until you learn to look like love.
