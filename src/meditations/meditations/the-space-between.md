The space between
is where you find reality.

Between inhale and exhale,
sound and echo,
thought and response,
there lies a silence
that holds everything together.

We chase the things –
the form, the word, the movement –
forgetting that their meaning
exists only because of the distance between them.

Listen for a sound,
then listen after it ends.
Notice that the ending
is not absence
but a room in which presence rests.

Reality is relational.
It is not the note or the rest
but the interval that makes the song.
To find truth
is not to hold tighter,
but to attend more gently
to what connects.

Live in the spaces.
Speak from them.
Think between thoughts.
There you will find
the quiet hum of existence itself.
