---

I try not to be someone
or gain something in particular.
Of course, there are plans,
and goals –
but they are less about achievement
and more about keeping promises
to myself and to others.

To live honestly
is to honour the agreements
that make your life coherent.
But to live freely
is to avoid being imprisoned by them.

Think of the goals you hold most tightly.
Ask whose voice first named them.
Are they born of love or comparison?
Of duty or disguise?

You are not a brand to build,
nor a story to perfect.
You are a rhythm
learning how to listen to itself.

Let your promises guide you
without defining you.
Keep faith with what matters,
but leave enough room
for grace to rearrange the plan.

Be someone only when needed,
then return to being no one –
so that life can find you again.
