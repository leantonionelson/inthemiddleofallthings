# They've Never Stopped

Some people still eat every two to three hours –
they've never stopped.
Not just the act,
but the state.
The infant rhythm of need,
of constant reaching outward
for warmth, for soothing, for validation.

Their bodies grew,
but their hunger did not mature.
It changed shape,
took new names –
attention, approval, distraction, love.
But it was always the same cry,
the same reaching hand in the dark.

Look around you.
The world is full of grown infants –
souls that never learned
how to feed themselves from within.
They seek the breast of the world,
suckling endlessly on comfort,
never learning the quiet discipline
of being nourished by stillness.

To grow is not to stop needing.
It is to learn the sacred exchange
between inner and outer life.
The infant consumes.
The adult integrates.
The wise give.

Some people still eat every two to three hours –
they've never stopped.
They feed on affirmation,
on being right,
on being seen.
And yet the hunger remains
because they've mistaken being held
for being whole.

Maturity begins
when you can hold yourself.
When you can sit in the ache
without demanding the world to fill it.
When you can feed from silence
and find it sweet.

The goal was never independence.
It was self-sustaining love.
To become your own parent,
your own nourishment,
your own peace.

So when you feel the infant stirring within,
do not scold it.
Hold it.
Feed it what it truly needs –
presence.
And perhaps, finally,
you will know what it means to grow.
