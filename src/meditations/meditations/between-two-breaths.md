Inhale.
Exhale.
This is the whole rhythm of existence.

Life is not in the breath taken,
nor in the breath released.
It is in the space between—
the pause where neither clinging nor letting go remains.

Life exists between two breaths.
The inhale is becoming.
The exhale is surrender.
But between them is stillness,
a moment without striving,
without fear.
A moment where you simply are.

Pause here.
Notice your breathing.
Feel the rise.
Feel the fall.
Now feel the quiet at the edge of each.
That quiet is life's centre.
The axis around which all else turns.

The mind races toward the future,
back into the past.
But the body knows—
the present is only ever the breath,
and the silence between.

Life exists between two breaths.
It teaches you balance.
You cannot only inhale—
to take without end is suffocation.
You cannot only exhale—
to give without return is death.
Both are needed,
but the truth of being rests in neither.
It rests in the gap,
the meeting point,
the eternal middle.

Stay here.
Breathe as though each cycle
is the whole story of existence.
Inhale: creation.
Exhale: dissolution.
Between: eternity.

Life is not elsewhere.
It is here,
resting quietly,
between two breaths.
