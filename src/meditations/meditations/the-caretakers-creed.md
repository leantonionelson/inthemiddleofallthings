# The Caretaker's Creed

Caring for life
is about creating a safe environment –
not controlling it.

Love protects,
but it must not cage.

Think of something or someone
you wish to keep safe.
Now ask –
does my care create space,
or confinement?

To nurture is to trust
the intelligence of life itself.
A flower does not bloom by command.
It opens when the conditions
feel kind enough to try.

Your task is not to shape life,
but to shelter its unfolding.
Safety is the soil;
freedom, the sunlight.
Together they grow the soul.
