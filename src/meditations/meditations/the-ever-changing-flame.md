# The Ever-Changing Flame

I am the flame —
a single form,
forever changing.

No moment repeats,
no self stays.
Continuity is a mirage;
what endures is motion.

Pause here.
Watch a candle flicker.
Each second,
it dies and is reborn.
So too with you.

Identity is not a statue.
It is fire learning its own pattern.
To cling is to smother;
to allow is to illuminate.

You are not the smoke that fades,
nor the wax that melts —
you are the light
that persists through change.
