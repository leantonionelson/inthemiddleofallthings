# When Needs Go Hungry, Ego Eats

The more your needs are unmet,
the louder the ego shouts.

Ego is not a monster in the attic.
It is a frightened child at the door,
performing size to secure a seat at the table.
Deprive the body of safety,
and the psyche puts on armour.

Pause here.
Name a recent overreaction.
Trace it back.
Which need was hungry —
rest, respect, touch, choice, shelter, certainty?
Feed the right one.
Do not punish the child for crying.

Compassion is not indulgence.
It is accurate care.
Meet the need
and the ego softens its jaw.
Neglect it
and the mask must harden.

Set boundaries, yes.
But also set the table.
When needs are nourished,
the self does not need a crown
to feel like a person.
