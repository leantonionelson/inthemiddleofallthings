# The Breath of Life

---

Flare your nostrils and breathe –
especially when eating.

Taste begins in attention.
Life does too.

The body hungers for presence
more than for food.

Take one deep breath
through the nose.
Feel the air widen you.
Let gratitude rise
with the exhale.

To breathe consciously
is to return home
to the animal grace of being alive.

Every meal,
every moment,
can be prayer
when breath is remembered.
