Every boundary recognises form.
Every box depends on corners –
edges for catching,
lines for holding in.
But what if you simply changed your shape?

The easiest way to get out of a box
is to be the least shaped like a box.

The walls cannot hold
what does not conform.
Constraint only works
when you agree to its geometry.

Think of your limits –
the definitions you've accepted:
who you think you are,
what you believe you can do,
what others say is possible.
Each is a box.
Each depends on your agreement
to fit its outline.

Now soften.
Let the corners of identity blur.
Let certainty loosen its angles.
Become fluid, round, formless.
Notice how, in that shift,
the boundaries begin to dissolve.

Freedom is not always found in force.
It is found in flexibility.
The rigid self is captured easily;
the adaptable self passes through untouched.

To be the least shaped like a box
is to remember that your essence
was never meant to harden.
You are a current, not a cube.
A flame, not a frame.

So when life tries to define you,
reshape yourself.
When judgement tries to contain you,
flow through its gaps.
When fear builds a wall,
become mist and move beyond it.

The easiest way to get out of a box
is to stop pretending you belong inside one.

You were never meant to have edges.
You were meant to expand.
