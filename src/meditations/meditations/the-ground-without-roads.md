Truth does not live at the end of a trail.
It cannot be mapped, inherited, or taught.
It has no temple, no teacher, no doctrine.
It is not reached by footsteps,
but recognised by stillness.

Truth is a pathless land.
It cannot be followed,
because to follow is already to lose it.
The moment someone claims a way,
a system,
a formula –
the truth has slipped through their fingers.

Truth cannot be organised.
It is too alive for that.
It does not belong to belief
or to those who speak most loudly of it.
It belongs only to awareness –
to the quiet seeing that perceives
without conclusion.

Notice the impulse to seek.
It feels noble, purposeful, familiar.
Now trace it deeper:
who is seeking?
What does the seeker want to find?
The more you look,
the more you discover that the seeker and the sought
are not two.
The search itself is the veil.

Every path promises direction,
but direction implies distance,
and distance implies separation.
Truth has none.
It is what remains
when every path dissolves.

This is why enlightenment cannot be given.
It is not a destination,
but a recognition:
that you were never apart from truth –
you were simply looking elsewhere.

Religions, philosophies, teachers –
they can point,
but the finger is never the moon.
The moment you worship the path,
you've forgotten the light it was meant to reveal.

Truth is the open field
beneath every structure.
The moment you stop building roads,
you find yourself standing on it.
It was always here –
beneath your feet,
beneath your questions,
beneath the seeking itself.

Truth is a pathless land.
To walk it
is to stop walking.
To find it
is to stop searching.
And in that stillness,
you realise –
you were never travelling.
You were home all along.
