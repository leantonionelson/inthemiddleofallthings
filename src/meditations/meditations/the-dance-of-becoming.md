Change is the rhythm of existence.
It does not ask for permission.
It does not wait for readiness.
It simply moves –
like tide,
like breath,
like time itself unfolding.

The only way to make sense out of change
is to plunge into it,
move with it,
and join the dance.

We spend so much energy resisting –
anchoring ourselves to what was familiar,
clutching to the version of ourselves
that the world once recognised.
But resistance does not stop the current;
it only exhausts the swimmer.

Think of a change you feared
that later became your freedom.
How it only revealed its meaning
once you surrendered to its motion.
That is the hidden mercy of change –
it teaches you to trust
that falling apart is another way of opening.

To join the dance
is to stop arguing with rhythm.
To move with life
as it moves through you.
To let go of choreography
and become the music itself.

Change is not chaos.
It is choreography too vast to predict.
The steps feel uncertain
because they are not yours to lead.
The universe leads.
You follow.
And when you stop counting beats,
you realise you were never out of sync –
you were only thinking too loudly to hear the song.

The only way to make sense out of change
is to move with it.
Sense comes after.
Meaning blooms after.
For now,
there is only rhythm.

Plunge in.
Let movement become meditation.
Let uncertainty become art.
And you will find
that change was never trying to break you –
only trying to teach you how to dance.
