Truth does not belong to anyone.
It refracts like light through glass –
different angles,
different colours,
the same brilliance seen through shifting form.

Everybody is right.
Not completely,
not absolutely,
but partially –
for each of us touches the infinite
from a different side.

The wise do not cling to their view;
they gather the fragments of others
and weave them into wholeness.

Think of a belief that opposes yours,
something that stirs resistance.
Now soften the edges.
Ask yourself,
"What truth is this person touching
that I cannot yet see?"
It may be small,
but it is there –
for even the mistaken view
is anchored to something real.

Everybody, including you,
is holding a shard of the same mirror.
Each reflection is incomplete,
but together they form the face of God.

To honour every fragment
is not to surrender discernment.
It is to recognise that the unity of truth
can only be revealed through multiplicity.
When you exclude another's perspective,
you limit your own.
When you embrace it,
you expand the horizon of what can be known.

This is the compassion of understanding –
not agreement,
but inclusion.
The willingness to let the universe
speak through a thousand voices
without deciding which one should be silenced.

Everybody is right,
because reality is too vast
to fit into a single mind.
Your truth, my truth, their truth –
each a wave rising from the same sea.

So listen deeply,
even to those you resist.
Especially to those you resist.
For the part of them you reject
may hold the missing piece
your soul came here to remember.

And in that remembering,
you'll discover:
no one was ever entirely wrong –
just speaking their truth
from where they stood in the light.
