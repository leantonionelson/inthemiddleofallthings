Pain sharpens attention.
It gathers the mind,
draws it like iron to a magnet,
until there is only one point—
the ache,
the burn,
the throb.

Discomfort does what comfort cannot.
It forces you into presence.
It leaves no room for wandering thought,
no escape into distraction.
You are here.
Completely.

This is why it is easy to meditate in the presence of pain.
Not because pain is pleasant.
But because pain is honest.
It does not lie.
It does not drift.
It insists: look at me.
And in looking,
you arrive.

Pause here.
Bring to mind a moment of pain.
Notice how it commanded your whole being.
How even in protest,
your awareness was absolute.
That is meditation—
the unbroken attention on what is.

Pain is not the enemy of stillness.
It is the doorway to it.
If you can sit with pain,
not resist,
not flee,
but observe—
you will find clarity waiting beneath it.

The breath deepens.
The body, though aching,
learns it can endure.
The mind, though restless,
learns it can release.

It's easy to meditate in the presence of pain
because pain strips away illusion.
It leaves only truth.
And truth, however raw,
is the ground of awakening.

Do not fear it.
Do not worship it.
Simply let it guide you back
to the stillness that was always here.
