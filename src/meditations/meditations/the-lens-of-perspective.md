# The Lens of Perspective

Most "truths"
are open to perspective.

Every statement
is a window angled toward light.
Change the angle,
and the light changes too.

Think of a disagreement that still stings.
Both sides believed they saw clearly.
Both were right –
and neither was complete.

Truth is not a flag to defend.
It is a mirror that multiplies
as you walk around it.
From one side: conviction.
From another: contradiction.
Both are partial.

Humility begins
when you stop asking who is right
and start asking
what each is seeing.

Perspective does not weaken truth;
it reveals its depth.
Only those willing to turn the mirror
learn how wide reality truly is.
