Turn pain into wisdom.

This is the true alchemy —
not of metals,
but of meaning.

Pain is raw awareness
without interpretation.
Wisdom is what happens
when awareness learns compassion.

Pause here.
Recall something that hurt you deeply.
Now ask —
what did it teach that comfort never could?

Pain refines perception.
It opens the soul's eyes
to what was previously unseen.

Do not curse the fire
that forges you.
Thank it for giving form
to your strength.

Pain is not the opposite of peace.
It is the path that leads there.
