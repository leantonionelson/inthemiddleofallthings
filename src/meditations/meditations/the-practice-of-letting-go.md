# The Practice of Letting Go

Letting go is not a single moment.
It is a practice.
A returning to,
again and again,
the open hand.

Notice what you are holding:
Old grievances.
Future worries.
The need to be right.
The fear of being wrong.

Feel the weight of these things
in your hands,
in your heart,
in your body.

Now breathe.
And on the exhale,
soften your grip.

You do not have to throw anything away.
You do not have to force release.
Simply soften.
Simply allow.

What is yours will remain.
What is not yours
was never yours to begin with.

The river does not hold onto the water
that flows through it.
The tree does not clutch its leaves
when autumn comes.

You are part of this same wisdom.
This same flow.
This same trust.

Practice opening.
Practice releasing.
Practice the courage
of the empty hand
that can receive
whatever comes next.
