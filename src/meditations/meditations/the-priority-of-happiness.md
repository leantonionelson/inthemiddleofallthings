The world will tell you otherwise.
It will tell you to put duty first,
appearance first,
expectation first.
But if happiness is neglected,
everything else fractures.

Put your happiness first.
Not as selfishness,
but as foundation.
A house cannot stand
if the ground beneath it crumbles.
A life cannot flourish
if the heart beneath it is starved.

Pause here.
Ask yourself:
What does happiness feel like in my body?
Not the idea of it,
not the picture others sold me,
but the sensation itselfâ€”
ease in the chest,
lightness in the eyes,
a rhythm of breath that feels unburdened.

This is the compass.
This is what must be placed first.

When you put your happiness first,
you bring strength to your duty.
You bring presence to your love.
You bring generosity to your service.
Without it,
you bring only shadow,
going through motions that cost more than they give.

Happiness is not a prize.
It is an orientation.
A way of choosing,
moment by moment,
to move where joy still breathes.

Put your happiness first.
For when you do,
you lift not only yourself,
but everyone who moves within your orbit.
