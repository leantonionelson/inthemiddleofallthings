# The Stillness That Clarifies

We stir too much.
The mind, restless and afraid of quiet,
keeps reaching into the water of life —
trying to fix, to clarify, to understand.
But every grasp sends up new clouds of silt.
Every effort to force stillness
only deepens the murk.

Muddy water is best cleared
by leaving it alone.
Clarity is not achieved;
it is revealed,
once movement ceases.

Pause here.
Let your thoughts settle like sediment.
Do nothing.
Not even "try to be still."
Simply stop disturbing the surface.
Watch what happens.

Slowly, the water clears itself.
Not because you acted,
but because you didn't.
Not through struggle,
but through surrender.

The same is true of the mind.
Insight arises naturally
when interference ends.
Peace does not need to be constructed;
it needs only to be uncovered.
The more you chase resolution,
the farther it runs.
The more you release control,
the closer truth approaches.

We are conditioned to believe
that effort is virtue.
But in the realm of the spirit,
effort often disturbs
what grace would have restored on its own.

Muddy water is best cleared
by leaving it alone.
Trust in the intelligence of stillness.
It knows how to heal itself.

The clarity you seek
is already there,
waiting beneath the surface
for your willingness to stop stirring.

So stop.
Let the water clear.
Let the moment breathe.
And when you finally see to the bottom,
you will realise
it was never the water that was clouded —
only your need to control its calm.
