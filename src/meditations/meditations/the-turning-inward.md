To look outward
is to see reflections –
the moving shadows of your own mind
cast upon the world.
To look inward
is to meet the source of light itself.

Who looks outside, dreams;
who looks inside, awakes.

The dream of life is seductive.
It fills the senses with movement and meaning,
each thing demanding to be touched,
named, owned, remembered.
But all of it –
the ambitions, the loves, the losses –
exists only as long as you're looking outward.
Close your eyes,
and the dream pauses.

Take a slow breath.
Notice how the world disappears
when you stop feeding it with attention.
Where does that attention go now?
Into the silent watcher –
the one who sees,
but is not seen.

To look inside
is not withdrawal;
it is awakening.
It is returning to the consciousness
from which all appearances arise.
It is remembering
that you are not the dreamer lost in the dream –
you are the dreaming itself.

When you look outside,
you live in contrast:
gain and loss,
hope and despair.
When you look within,
you live in essence.
Stillness.
Awareness without object.

The outward gaze builds worlds;
the inward gaze dissolves them.
One creates meaning.
The other reveals truth.
Both are sacred,
but only one leads home.

Who looks outside, dreams;
who looks inside, awakes.
Do not fear waking –
it will not take you from life;
it will give you back to it,
whole and unafraid.
