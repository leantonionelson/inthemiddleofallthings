Emotions move like weather –
shifting, unpredictable,
beautiful, sometimes violent,
but never permanent.
They pass through the atmosphere of the self,
but they are not the self.

Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky.
Conscious breathing is my anchor.

The breath does not chase the storm;
it stays steady,
rhythmic, faithful.
It reminds you that beneath every emotion,
there is a vastness untouched by turbulence –
the clear sky of awareness.

Inhale slowly.
Feel the breath expand your chest.
Exhale fully.
Notice how stillness returns,
even if only for a moment.
That is the anchor –
the return to the eternal now.

When emotion rises,
do not cling or fight.
Observe.
Name it gently:
fear, anger, joy, sorrow.
Watch it drift across the field of awareness
like a passing cloud.
You are not the cloud.
You are the sky.

The breath keeps you rooted
in that truth.
It tethers you to presence,
to the body,
to being.
It does not deny feeling;
it steadies it.
It lets the wave move through
without drowning you in its tide.

Life will always bring wind.
Some days it howls.
Some days it hums.
But the practice is the same:
return to the anchor.
Return to the breath.
Let consciousness hold you steady
as the sky holds the weather.

You cannot stop the clouds,
but you can remember
that they do not define the sky.

Breathe.
Be.
And know:
all that passes through you
is only passing through.
