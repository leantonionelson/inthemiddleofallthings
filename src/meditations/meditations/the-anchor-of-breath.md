# The Anchor of Breath

The body remembers before the mind.
It tightens, it heats, it braces.
The trigger arrives—
a word, a look, a memory—
and suddenly you are no longer here.
You are caught,
pulled into a storm of reaction.

But the breath is always here.
Unmoved.
Unjudging.
Steady as the ground beneath your feet.

When triggered, focus on your breathing.
This is not escape.
It is return.
The breath does not deny what you feel.
It holds it.
It anchors you
so that the feeling can pass through
without consuming you.

Pause here.
Notice the inhale.
It rises like a tide.
Notice the exhale.
It recedes like a tide.
Both come without your asking.
Both remind you:
you are more than this moment of reaction.

The mind wants to fight,
to justify,
to replay.
The breath asks only to be followed.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Again.
Again.

And with each cycle,
the storm loosens its grip.
The body softens.
The mind clears.
The self returns.

When triggered, focus on your breathing.
Because in the breath,
you are safe.
In the breath,
you are whole.
In the breath,
you are free to choose—
not from fear,
not from reflex,
but from presence.
