# The Comfort in Discomfort

When pain is felt,
take comfort in it.
It allows
for the removal of fragility.

Fragility hides
in what we refuse to feel.
Endurance grows
only through encounter.

Pause here.
Recall a season of ache
that shaped you.
Notice what grew
in the ruins.

Comfort born from pain
is not pleasure —
it is proof of transformation.
Like muscle under strain,
the soul strengthens
through stretch.

Pain is not punishment.
It is the pressure
through which truth emerges.
