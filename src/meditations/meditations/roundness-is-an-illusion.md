# Roundness Is an Illusion

From far away everything looks smooth.
Wholeness appears as a circle,
seamless, perfect, complete.

Come closer.
Perfection grows angles.
What looked like roundness
reveals an edge,
a seam,
a grain.

Roundness is an illusion.
It is not deceit,
only distance.

Think of someone you idealise.
Now remember the first time
you saw their humanity up close –
the fatigue,
the doubt,
the tender flaw.
If your love survived,
it became truer.

Closeness does not break wholeness.
It gives it dimension.
Depth is the honesty
that replaces fantasy with relationship.

Let the world keep its curves from afar.
But when it is time to love,
approach.
Let edges appear.
Let texture replace theory.
Only then can you hold what is real
without dropping it.
