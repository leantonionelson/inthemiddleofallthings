Heaven and hell are not destinations.
They are dimensions within the same moment –
different rooms of the same mind.
You move between them every day.

Heaven is not reward,
and hell is not punishment.
Both are the weather
of your consciousness.
They arise in the now you choose to inhabit.

My theory of heaven and hell
is simple:
they are internal states,
shaped by orientation.
The body never leaves the present,
but the mind does –
wandering into guilt,
projection,
regret,
fear.
There, in that distortion of now,
hell begins.

Feel what it's like to be entirely present.
The breath steady,
the senses open,
the moment complete.
Notice how peace enters
the moment you stop fighting what is.
This is heaven –
not absence of pain,
but absence of resistance.

Hell is not fire;
it is friction –
the endless grinding of "what is"
against "what should be."
It burns not the body,
but the soul.

Heaven is surrender –
the willingness to see this moment
as enough.
It does not require perfection,
only perspective.

The gates are not in the sky.
They are thresholds of awareness.
At any instant,
you can step from one to the other
by choosing how to see,
how to breathe,
how to be.

Heaven and hell are simultaneous,
co-existing potentials of now.
Which you experience
depends on the orientation of your mind.

So practice presence.
Tend your inner atmosphere.
When you find yourself descending,
pause, breathe, soften.
Remind yourself:
it was never the world that burned –
only the thought that refused to let go.
