Confidence is not armour.
It is not the loud voice in the room.
It is not the mask that hides doubt.

Confidence is alignment.
The inner and the outer moving as one.
Desire and reason,
will and purpose,
walking in step.

Doing what you want is only half.
Without reason, it drifts into impulse,
scattering itself in every direction.
Having a reason is only half.
Without desire, it becomes duty,
heavy and lifeless.

But when you do what you want
and know why you want it,
you stand on solid ground.
Your steps are not tentative.
They belong to you.

Pause here.
Think of something you truly want.
Not what was handed to you.
Not what was expected of you.
Something that stirs your chest when you name it.

Now ask: why?
Not once, but again and againâ€”
until the reason is clear,
until it feels unshakable.

This is the root of confidence.
Not perfection.
Not the absence of fear.
But the knowledge that your action rises
from your own centre.

Confidence does not guarantee success.
It does not guarantee approval.
But it guarantees presence.
It guarantees that when you move,
you are not divided.

Confidence comes from doing what you want
and having a good reason for it.
Two wings of the same bird.
With one, you flap in circles.
With both, you fly.
