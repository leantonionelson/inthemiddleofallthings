Truth does not need a mouthpiece.
It speaks through wind,
through silence,
through the pulse that moves in you
when words fall short.

Watch out for those who claim to own it.
For those who speak the word of God
as if it were a banner to wave,
rather than a mystery to live.

They are still human—
beautiful,
fallible,
hungry for certainty.
And when certainty hardens,
it builds altars to itself.

Pause here.
Feel how easy it is
to want someone else to know for you,
to take their confidence
as proof of their purity.
But no one can mediate your divinity.
God has no middleman.

Those who truly walk with the sacred
speak softly.
They do not command belief.
They point,
then step aside.

The danger of priesthood
is not the robe or the ritual.
It is forgetting that the divine
moves through everyone equally—
the sinner and the saint,
the fool and the wise,
the silence and the sound.

You may take comfort in their guidance,
but do not surrender your seeing.
Let every sacred word
pass through the filter of your own heart.
If it resonates with peace,
follow it.
If it breeds fear,
release it.

The divine does not hide behind hierarchy.
It whispers directly.
And when you are still enough,
you realise—
you were never waiting to hear them.
You were waiting to hear yourself.
