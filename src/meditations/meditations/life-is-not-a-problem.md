The mind loves to complicate.
It treats life as a riddle,
a puzzle to be solved,
a sequence of obstacles to overcome.

But life is not a problem.
It is not waiting for you to figure it out.
It is not holding back a secret answer.
It is simply unfolding,
moment after moment,
with or without your interpretation.

Get over yourself.
The weight you feel is often the weight you created –
the drama of self-importance,
the constant measuring of "how am I doing?"
The universe does not measure.
It moves.

Breathe.
Notice how the body rises and falls.
This is life.
Not a puzzle,
not a test,
but a rhythm.
Your breath does not ask to be solved.
It asks only to be allowed.

Think of the times you called something a problem.
Was it not simply a situation?
Was it not simply change demanding attention?
The label "problem" is yours,
not life's.

To get over yourself is to step aside.
To let the river flow
without needing to control its course.
To stop insisting that your meaning
must be the world's meaning.

Life is not against you.
It is not for you either.
It simply is.
And in that simplicity,
it is vast, generous, and free.

Get over yourself.
Lay down the armour of self-centred struggle.
Step into the open field
where things are not problems
but processes.
Not burdens
but movements.

Life is not a problem.
It is your being here,
breathing,
moving,
experiencing.
Nothing to fix.
Only to live.
