# The Magic of Assumed Creation

---

Think of life as magic.
If you wish it,
it has already begun.

Time is only the medium
through which action travels.
Desire sets the trajectory.

Hold a quiet wish in mind.
See it as done.
Now act as though
the universe is catching up.

Belief collapses possibility
into form.
To live as if
is to co-author with time.

Do not rush it.
The spell is in the patience.
Creation, like growth,
unfolds at the pace of trust.
