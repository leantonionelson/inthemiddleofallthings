We dream in straight lines,
but life unfolds in spirals.
We draw maps,
yet the path beneath our feet
is rewritten with every step.

We must be willing to let go of the life we planned
so as to have the life that is waiting for us.

The plan is comfort –
a story we tell to calm the mind's need for control.
But destiny is conversation,
not command.
It listens to your intent,
then replies in its own language.
And often, its reply is change.

Think of the plans you once clung to –
how they shimmered with certainty,
and how life, with quiet grace,
undid them.
Not to punish you,
but to redirect you
toward what your soul truly asked for
before your mind could name it.

Letting go is not failure;
it is faith.
It is acknowledging that there is a wisdom
beyond your strategies,
a choreography that moves
with deeper rhythm than thought.

The life you planned
was built from what you knew.
The life that waits
is built from what you are.
It asks not for perfection,
but for presence.
It requires not certainty,
but surrender.

There is no shame in outgrowing a dream.
The plan served its purpose –
it got you moving.
Now let it rest.
The next step can only appear
to the feet that have stopped gripping the ground.

We must be willing to release
the architecture of expectation
and trust the living architecture of becoming.
To trade control for connection,
ambition for alignment.

The life that is waiting
does not need your plan –
only your openness.
Only your yes.
