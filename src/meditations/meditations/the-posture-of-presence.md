# The Posture of Presence

The body carries truth before the mind.
It remembers tension,
it remembers openness,
and it shapes the way you move through the world.

Arch your lower back.
Let the spine rise.
Hang your shoulders,
loose and heavy,
as if gravity is a friend you can trust.

Already the breath deepens.
Already the chest opens.
Already the body remembers a quieter strength.

This is more than posture.
It is orientation.
A way of saying: I will not collapse inward.
I will not curl into the armour of defence.
I will stand,
balanced between effort and release.

Pause here.
Try it now.
Notice how the space in your lungs grows
when the shoulders are allowed to hang.
Notice how the heart feels less caged
when the spine is lifted with dignity.
Notice how the mind steadies
when the body signals readiness.

Life will always try to bend you forwardâ€”
burden, grief, distraction, fatigue.
But the body can remind the soul:
there is another way to meet the world.

Arch your lower back.
Hang your shoulders.
Find the posture that is both strong and soft,
alert and surrendered.

This is presence.
This is balance.
Not rigid.
Not limp.
But open.
The body's way of saying: I am here.
