Reality is not fixed.
It flickers –
a sea of potential
that solidifies only when seen.

Every atom waits to be witnessed,
every possibility hums beneath perception,
and when attention lands,
the wave collapses,
form arises,
and the universe, once again,
takes shape around awareness.

Reality emerges through the iterative collapse
of wave functions within the eternal now.
Not once, but forever –
a constant creation,
a rhythm of becoming and being.

Close your eyes.
Notice the gentle shifting of thought,
how each one appears,
exists for a breath,
and dissolves into stillness.
That same pattern is the pulse of reality.
You are both the silence and the sound.

Consciousness participates in creation.
It is not observer; it is partner.
Your attention is not passive;
it is the sculptor's hand,
deciding which potentials bloom into form.
When you focus on fear,
you build a world that trembles.
When you attend to peace,
the fabric of existence
aligns to match your inner field.

The eternal now is the canvas;
consciousness is the brushstroke.
Each thought,
each choice,
each breath
collapses the infinite
into the shape of your belief.

You are not separate from reality.
You are its articulation –
a phrase spoken by the universe
to describe itself.

So choose your gaze carefully.
See beauty,
and beauty becomes real.
See love,
and the cosmos unfolds in tenderness.
Reality is not happening to you.
It is happening through you.

In every moment,
you decide what the universe looks like
from your point of light.
