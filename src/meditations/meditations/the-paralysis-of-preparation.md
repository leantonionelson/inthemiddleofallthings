The mind loves to prepare.
It builds maps,
draws lines,
organises every path
before taking a single step.
It mistakes rehearsal for progress,
and thought for motion.

Planning is the enemy of action.
Not because foresight is wrong,
but because control becomes comfort,
and comfort kills momentum.

You can plan forever
and never move an inch.
You can perfect the conditions for beginning
and still never begin.
The plan becomes a cocoon –
safe, detailed, lifeless.

Think of something you've delayed
because you were "not ready."
Notice how long the preparation has stretched,
how the energy that once burned bright
has cooled into anxiety.
That is the weight of overthinking.
That is the gravity of fear disguised as wisdom.

Action is messy,
imperfect,
alive.
It doesn't wait for clarity;
it creates it.
Each movement reveals the next.
Each mistake becomes instruction.

The plan imagines.
The act discovers.
And the universe responds not to intention,
but to motion.
Nothing real begins
until you are in the doing.

Planning has its place –
but only as a breath before the leap,
not the reason to never jump.
The truth is:
you can always plan better,
but you can never plan enough.

Life rewards risk, not readiness.
And readiness, paradoxically,
arrives only after you move.

So stop rehearsing your courage.
Spend it.
Let the act itself
be your plan.
