# The Weight of Self-Interest

A civilisation built on the self
inevitably forgets the soul.
When every act is measured in profit,
compassion becomes inefficient,
and generosity, unmarketable.

People in the West,
in a capitalist nation,
do not lift a finger
if not for their own benefit.
And in this quiet confession
lies the sickness of our time –
a blindness born not of cruelty,
but of conditioning.

Consider the pulse of the modern world.
The ceaseless exchange,
the relentless pursuit of "more."
Even kindness,
too often,
is traded like currency –
a means to reputation,
to belonging,
to return.

But real giving has no ledger.
It is born from abundance,
not scarcity.
It asks for nothing back
because it has already received
everything it needs –
the simple knowing of connection.

Capitalism teaches the illusion of separation.
It convinces us that the other's loss
can be our gain.
But the soul knows otherwise.
Every act of selfishness
carves a wound in the collective body
we all inhabit.

Ask yourself –
when was the last time you acted
without strategy?
Without expectation?
When was the last time you offered
your time, your love, your listening,
for no reason but the truth
that another's ease
is also your own?

The sickness of self-interest
can only be healed
by the remembering of unity.
To serve another
is not to sacrifice,
but to restore balance.
To give without reason
is the highest form of reason.

People in the West may not lift a finger
without reward.
But perhaps the reward they've forgotten
is the simplest one of all –
the quiet joy that comes
when the hand that reaches out
for another
also lifts itself.
