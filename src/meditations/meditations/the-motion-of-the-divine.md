We were taught to see God as a thing –
a throne, a figure,
a presence to worship from afar.
But divinity does not sit still.
It moves.
It breathes.
It becomes.

God is a verb, not a noun.
Not the object of existence,
but its action.
Not the name,
but the happening beneath the name.

Every pulse of life is its expression.
Every birth, decay, renewal –
the endless grammar of creation.

Look at your hands.
They are doing what the universe does –
shaping, touching, transforming.
When you move with awareness,
you do not imitate God;
you participate in God.

The divine is not a being to seek.
It is being itself –
the current that turns thought into matter,
matter into meaning,
meaning back into silence.

When you pray,
you are not speaking to God.
You are aligning with God.
When you love,
you are not pleasing the divine;
you are becoming it.

God is motion.
The expansion of stars,
the folding of cells,
the breath that both gives and receives.

The moment you fix God as a noun,
you cage the infinite.
You turn the river into an idol of ice.
But the divine melts every boundary you draw.

God is a verb.
To live is to conjugate it.
To act with awareness is to worship.
To love is to speak its true name.

And when you finally stop asking where God is,
you will feel it –
not watching you,
but moving through you.
