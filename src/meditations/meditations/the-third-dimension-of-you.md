# The Third Dimension of You

Remember –
no one sees you
the way you see yourself.

You are confined to reflections:
mirrors, pictures, recordings –
flat surfaces of interpretation.
Others meet you
in three dimensions,
alive and dynamic,
as you truly are.

Recall a moment of self-consciousness.
You thought you looked odd,
spoke awkwardly,
took up too much space.
And yet, the person beside you
saw none of it.
They saw a presence,
not a performance.

The self you judge
is an image, not a being.
Release the obsession with angles.
Step into depth.

The mirror shows contour,
but not warmth.
Others see your warmth.
And when you begin to feel yourself
from within rather than without,
the reflection loses its authority.

You are not two-dimensional.
You are light in motion.
Let yourself be seen
as you already are – whole.
