Time is the illusion of unfolding.
We speak of past and future
as if they were places,
but there is only this –
the living stillness between what was imagined
and what will be.

The eternal now
is the point of creation.

Everything that ever was,
everything that will ever be,
emerges from this moment,
again and again,
as if existence were constantly
breathing itself awake.

Let your awareness settle.
Do not chase the next thought.
Do not reach for the last.
Rest in the centre –
the place between them.
That is where eternity hides.

Creation is not an event in history.
It is the constant trembling
of possibility into form.
Every choice,
every perception,
every heartbeat
is the universe creating itself anew.

You are not a witness to this process;
you are its instrument.
When you think, you shape it.
When you love, you align it.
When you fear, you distort it.
But always,
the act of creation continues,
with or without your permission.

The eternal now
is not a moment in time –
it is what time passes through.
It is the canvas that never changes,
the still point that allows movement,
the silence that makes sound possible.

All creation happens here,
in the infinite immediacy of being.
When you enter it fully,
you realise:
you were never made.
You are being made –
constantly.

Every breath is genesis.
Every awareness a new world.
The eternal now
is the axis of existence,
the still fire
from which all things are born.
