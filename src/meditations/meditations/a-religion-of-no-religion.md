# A Religion of No Religion

I have a religion
of no religion.

Not faithless —
but free.

Dogma divides;
awareness unites.
I worship nothing
and therefore
can revere everything.

Pause here.
Consider how many names
we've given to the same silence.
Each a doorway
to the same room.

When you cease to guard the door,
you finally enter.

My temple is the present moment.
My ritual is attention.
My god is existence itself —
formless, infinite,
and always here.
