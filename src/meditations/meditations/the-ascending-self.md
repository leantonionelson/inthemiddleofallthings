When the body grows still,
awareness loosens its grip.
The boundaries blur.
The "I" that sits behind the eyes
steps out of the cage of skin
and begins to rise.

At first it feels like detachment —
the self watching the self,
a ghost observing a body.
But then comes peace.
Not escape,
but expansion.
As though gravity itself has forgiven you.

You are light now.
You see the form below
and realise it was never the entirety of you.
You are the watcher,
the witness,
the awareness behind both seer and seen.

This is the first stair.
There are others —
each one ascending further
into spaciousness,
into the vast calm
that holds all things without judgement.
This is heaven —
the return to perspective,
the lifting out of contraction.

Pause here.
Breathe deeply.
Notice how the more you release control,
the lighter you become.
The body softens,
the mind widens.
Heaven begins not in place,
but in orientation —
outward, upward, open.

Hell, by contrast,
is the descent inward —
not the sacred inward of reflection,
but the obsessive narrowing of focus
until the self becomes the only landscape.
The mind looping upon itself
like a snake devouring its tail.
The pit of self-reference.
The darkness of endless analysis.

Heaven expands;
hell contracts.
Heaven is surrender;
hell is control.
Heaven is awareness spread across all existence;
hell is awareness trapped inside its own echo.

You do not need to die to ascend.
You only need to release your grip
on the smallest version of yourself.
Step back,
step up,
see yourself from the outside —
and remember:
you are not what you see.
You are what sees.
