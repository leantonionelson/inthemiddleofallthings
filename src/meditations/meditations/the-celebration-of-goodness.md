Life is not only trial.
It is not only burden.
It is woven, always, with moments of goodness—
quiet, fleeting, easily missed.

Notice them.
The warmth of sun on your face.
The sound of laughter in another room.
The stillness that comes when the breath settles.
These are not interruptions to life.
They are life.

Recognise them.
Do not let them slip past unnamed.
Say to yourself: This is good.
Anchor it in awareness.
Let your body register the texture of it.
So that when the harder hours arrive,
you carry the memory of goodness within you.

Celebrate them.
Not with spectacle,
but with presence.
Smile.
Breathe deeper.
Whisper gratitude into the air.
The celebration need not be grand—
it only needs to be sincere.

Pause here.
Recall a recent moment of goodness,
no matter how small.
Hold it in the mind.
Feel it in the chest.
Let it brighten you now
as it did then.

This is the practice:
to notice,
to recognise,
to celebrate.
To treat goodness not as accident,
but as nourishment.

Life will always carry difficulty.
But within it, always,
there are notes of sweetness.
If you learn to hear them,
you will never be starved.

Notice.
Recognise.
Celebrate.
When life is good,
let it be known—
to yourself,
to others,
to the moment itself.
