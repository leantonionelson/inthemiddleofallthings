# The Two Breaths

**Tags:** life, death, impermanence, awareness, time, simplicity, stillness, mindfulness, presence, rhythm

Life exists
between two breaths.

The first –
an arrival.
The last –
a release.

Everything else
is the space between.

Breathe in slowly.
Breathe out fully.
Feel how each cycle
is a miniature life –
birth, existence, surrender.

To live consciously
is to notice
how precious the middle is.

Every breath
is a reminder
that life is always now –
and only now.
