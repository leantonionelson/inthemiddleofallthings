# The Power of No

There is a weight in every word.
"Yes" expands.
It opens.
It commits.
But if spoken falsely,
"Yes" becomes a chain.

"No" contracts.
It draws a boundary.
It closes a door.
But if spoken truthfully,
"No" becomes freedom.

Say no when you mean no.
Because every false yes
is a fracture within yourself.
It pulls you away from your centre,
asks you to live a life
that is not yours.

Pause here.
Think of a time you said yes
when your body was already saying no.
Notice how it felt—
tightness in the chest,
weight in the stomach,
resentment in the heart.
Now think of a time you said no,
even when it was difficult.
Notice how it felt—
clear, steady, whole.

This is the difference.
No is not rejection.
It is orientation.
It keeps you aligned
to what is true in you.

Say no when you mean no.
It will not always please others.
But it will keep you from betraying yourself.
And when you do not betray yourself,
your yes regains its purity.
It becomes radiant,
undoubting,
a gift without resentment.

To live sincerely
is to let both words—yes and no—
be honest.
And honesty,
though it may cost in the moment,
always restores you to yourself.

So trust the no that arises.
It is not unkind.
It is necessary.
It is the ground on which your true life stands.
