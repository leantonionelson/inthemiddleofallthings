# The Path That Walks Itself

We spend our lives in pursuit –
of success, of peace,
of a happiness imagined always
just beyond the horizon.
We walk and walk,
believing joy to be a destination.
But joy was never waiting ahead.
It was walking beside us all along.

There is no way to happiness –
happiness is the way.

This is not a riddle;
it is a reversal of direction.
The path does not lead to joy.
The path is joy,
when walked with awareness.

Notice your breath.
You are breathing,
and therefore, you are living.
What more miraculous state
could happiness be?

Happiness is not a possession.
It is not an achievement.
It is orientation –
a turning of perception
toward the present.
It is gratitude without condition.
It is the quiet recognition
that even in pain,
there is life,
and in life,
there is possibility.

To seek happiness as outcome
is to postpone it endlessly.
But to walk as happiness itself
is to dissolve the illusion of distance.

The moment you stop asking,
"When will I be happy?"
and start whispering,
"I am happiness walking,"
everything shifts.

The struggle softens.
The destination disappears.
You realise there was never a journey –
only unfolding,
only presence,
only the living pulse of being.

Happiness is not what you find at the end.
It is what you bring to the beginning.
It is not something life gives you,
but something you give to life.

There is no way to happiness.
Happiness is the way.
And every step taken in that awareness
is already home.
