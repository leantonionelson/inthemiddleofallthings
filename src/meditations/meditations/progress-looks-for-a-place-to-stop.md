Progress is looking for a place to stop.

Movement defines it –
but not endless movement.
Even rivers meet the sea.

The impulse to improve
is holy until it becomes hunger.
Then it forgets what it was chasing.

Think of what you call growth.
Does it still nourish,
or has it become compulsion?
If progress cannot pause,
it has turned into fear.

Evolution is not a race.
It is a rhythm –
forward, still, forward, still.
Rest is not regression;
it is recognition.

True progress reaches a point
where it can finally say,
"I have become enough
to be still."

Only then
can it transform
into peace.
