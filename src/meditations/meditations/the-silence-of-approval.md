# The Silence of Approval

Stop seeking approval.

The need to be seen
keeps you from seeing yourself.

Approval is a mirror
that distorts reflection –
it shows not who you are,
but who others need you to be.

Think of the last compliment
that made you feel whole.
Then notice how quickly
the feeling faded.
No mirror can hold you for long.

Freedom begins
when you stop auditioning for love.
Be the witness of your own worth.
Let the applause fall silent
until your heartbeat
becomes enough applause.

Authenticity doesn't echo.
It simply resonates.
