Fire divides us from the wild.
It is both our fear and our belonging.
For every creature, flame is danger —
the signal of death,
the promise of ash.
But for us, it is memory.
It is home.

All life on earth fears fire apart from humans.
Because fire, to us, is not merely destruction.
It is transformation —
matter surrendering to light.

Pause here.
Picture the flicker of a flame.
See how it consumes
and yet illuminates.
See how it dances
without ever holding its shape.
That is what the soul does —
it burns in order to reveal.

When humans see fire,
they do not flee;
they draw closer.
The crackle calls them inward,
toward warmth,
toward story,
toward the shared breath that keeps the dark away.
Fire is the oldest form of community.

It reminds us that power and tenderness
are not opposites.
That the same element which destroys
can also nurture,
guide,
and gather.

Fire is the covenant we made with the universe —
we will carry your light into the night.
We will keep it, feed it,
and through it, remember you.

So sit by the flame and watch.
You will see yourself in it —
the consuming, the giving, the endless renewal.
You will feel the ancestral calm:
the danger that once terrified
now teaching warmth and wonder.

All life fears fire apart from humans.
Because we, of all creation,
were chosen to understand it —
to see not only the blaze,
but the home within it.

And when you see that glow
on the horizon of your life,
know this:
you are not lost.
You are returning.
