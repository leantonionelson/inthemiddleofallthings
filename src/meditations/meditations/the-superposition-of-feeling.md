# The Superposition of Feeling

**Tags:** emotion, awareness, quantum metaphor, presence, mindfulness, identity, observation, acceptance

---

I am a superposition
of all emotions.

When asked
if I am happy, sad, angry —
I say, yes.

All are true,
until observed.

It is my orientation
that collapses the wave function —
the direction of attention
that chooses which feeling
becomes form.

Pause here.
Notice your mood.
Then notice
the one who notices it.
From that vantage,
you are all possibilities at once.

Emotion is energy in motion.
You are the observer,
not the orbit.
