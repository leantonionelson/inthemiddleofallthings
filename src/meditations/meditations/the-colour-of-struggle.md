# The Colour of Struggle

For those who say
they don't see colour
in response to racism,
I say –
then you become blind
to my struggle.

To erase difference
is not to erase pain.
It is to ignore
where the wound still bleeds.

Reflect on what it means
to see someone fully.
Visibility is dignity.
Recognition is repair.

We cannot heal
what we refuse to look at.
To see colour
is to see context,
history,
inheritance,
humanity.

Seeing difference
does not divide us –
it allows compassion
to take shape.
