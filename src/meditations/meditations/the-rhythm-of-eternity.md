The universe has no edge.
It does not begin,
it does not end.
It folds, it expands, it transforms—
but it does not stop.

If the universe is eternal,
then nothing within it is truly lost.
Forms dissolve,
but the essence recurs.
Moments vanish,
but their pattern returns.
You, too, are bound to this rhythm.

You imagine yourself singular—
this body, this name, this fleeting breath.
But eternity does not recognise singular.
It recognises repetition,
variation,
renewal.

If the universe is eternal,
you are not a one-time occurrence.
You are a theme,
a melody that resurfaces across the endless score.
Each time played slightly differently,
each time carrying echoes of before.

Pause.
Ask yourself:
What part of me feels ancient?
What patterns return again and again,
as if written deeper than memory?

This is eternity showing itself through you.
Not reincarnation as story,
but recurrence as structure.
A design that insists on happening,
until it is complete.

You will happen again.
Not because you are preserved as you are,
but because the conditions that make you possible
will always return.
Like fire when spark meets breath.
Like waves when wind meets water.

Eternity is not something to reach.
It is the medium you already move in.
This life is not the only chance.
It is simply the current expression
of something that cannot end.

If the universe is eternal,
everything is eternal.
And you—
not just the story of you,
but the essence of you—
will rise again,
again,
and again.
