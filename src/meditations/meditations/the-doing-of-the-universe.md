The universe is not separate from you.
It is not something distant,
observed through glass.
It is the very act
of which you are a part.

We are what the universe does.
Just as the apple is what the tree does,
just as the wave is what the ocean does,
just as the flame is what fire doesâ€”
you are what the universe does.

Pause here.
Feel your breath.
It is not yours alone.
It is the atmosphere breathing you.
Feel your thoughts.
They are not isolated.
They are the mind of the universe
folding inward to look at itself.

We try to claim individuality
as if we are apart from the whole.
But the truth is simpler:
you are not in the universe.
You are of it.
You are it,
in one of its infinite gestures.

Consider how a flower blooms.
It does not think,
it does not strive.
It is simply the earth expressing itself.
You are no different.
Your being is the universe unfolding
in human form.

We are what the universe does.
And when you remember this,
the burden lifts.
You do not have to control the whole.
You only have to be faithful
to your place within it.

You are not an intruder here.
You are not accidental.
You are exactly what the universe is doing
at this point in space and time.

Rest in that.
It is not small.
It is vast.
It is enough.
