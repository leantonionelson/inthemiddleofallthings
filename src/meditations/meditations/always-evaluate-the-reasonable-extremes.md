# Always Evaluate the Reasonable Extremes

Every truth lives between two cliffs.
Too close to either edge
and reason falls.

The world presents itself in pairs:
activity and rest,
certainty and doubt,
devotion and freedom,
self and other.
Each extreme, alone,
is eloquent and dangerous.

Evaluate the reasonable extremes.
Do not reject the edges.
Let them name the field.
Stand close enough to feel their power,
far enough to keep your footing.

Think of a place you overcorrect –
work without sabbath,
speech without silence,
discipline without tenderness.
Now imagine its opposite,
not as an enemy,
but as a load-bearing wall.
Together they hold the roof.

Wisdom is not the middle by habit,
but the centre by awareness.
Sometimes the centre is near the left wall,
sometimes the right.
The point is not symmetry.
The point is stability that breathes.

The unwise cling to one pole
and call the other sin.
The wise test both currents,
learn their charge,
and choose the voltage the moment can carry.

Evaluate the reasonable extremes,
not to be indecisive,
but to be precise.
The heart that honours both edges
walks a path that does not crumble.
