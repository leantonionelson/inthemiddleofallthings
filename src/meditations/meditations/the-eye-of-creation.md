See creative acts
through the eye of the creator.

To create
is to participate
in the divine impulse
that first whispered
"Let there be."

When you make,
you mirror that original gesture –
bringing form to the formless,
order to the infinite.

Think of something you've made –
a sentence,
a meal,
a small act of kindness.
Now look at it
as the universe does:
with wonder,
not judgement.

Creation is less about producing
and more about revealing.
You are not the author
but the aperture
through which creation sees itself.

To see through the creator's eye
is to remember
that every act of making
is an act of being made.
