Creation did not finish.
It is not a story closed in the past.
From one perspective,
the universe began in a single flash,
a seed of everything compressed,
then opened.

But step inside time as we live it,
and that opening has not stopped.
It is still unfolding.
Galaxies still drift.
Stars still ignite.
Life still emerges.
Even you, in this breath,
are part of that same eruption.

The Big Bang was not once.
It is always.
It is happening now.

Pause here.
Feel your breath expand your chest.
This is expansion.
Feel your thoughts spark and scatter.
This is creation.
Feel your cells dividing, renewing.
This is the echo of that first fire.

From one perspective,
it was a moment.
From another,
it is the only momentâ€”
drawn out, stretched across eternity,
still speaking itself into being.

You are not after the beginning.
You are the beginning,
still expressing itself through form,
through time,
through consciousness.

When you feel small,
remember this:
you are not late to the story.
You are within its first word.
When you feel lost,
remember this:
you are moving inside the same current
that has carried galaxies.

From one perspective, the Big Bang is history.
From our perspective,
it is the present tense.
And in every breath,
every choice,
every act of awareness,
you continue the universe's becoming.
