The universe is not distance.
It is not matter.
It is not even time.

It is perspective—
layered, shifting, infinite.

From one vantage,
you are small.
A body on a planet,
a flicker between stars.

From another,
you are vast.
A consciousness carrying galaxies,
a centre from which worlds unfold.

Neither view is wrong.
Neither is complete.
They are layers—
each true,
each partial.

Look at your own life.
The argument you replay in your head
feels absolute at one scale.
Shift the layer,
and it is a moment already fading.
Shift again,
and it is a teacher,
delivering you to patience,
or forgiveness.

Layers upon layers—
not competing,
but nested.
Like skin,
like rings in a tree,
like atmospheres of a single world.

What you call "truth"
is only the layer you're standing on.
What you call "wisdom"
is the ability to move between them.

Now pause.
Ask yourself:
What layer am I inhabiting right now?
Is it too near,
pressing against my skin?
Is it too far,
cold with abstraction?
Or am I able to stand in one
while sensing the others?

The universe is not a single face.
It is a prism,
turning light into many colours.
To live well
is not to choose one,
but to see the whole spectrum—
and to remember
that the light itself never fractured.

The universe is just layers of perspective.
And you are both the layer
and the one who sees through them.
