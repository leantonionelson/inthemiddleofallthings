Everything you have ever known
has unfolded in this one moment.
Every memory,
every breath,
every thought of past or future
has occurred now.

Realise deeply
that the present moment
is all you ever have.

The mind moves in time.
It creates past as echo,
future as projection.
But existence itself
never leaves the present.
The eternal now
is the stage upon which
all experience appears and dissolves.

Feel the pulse in your chest.
It is not from yesterday,
nor does it belong to tomorrow.
It beats in the only place
life ever happens –
here.

We spend our days
postponing presence –
believing meaning lies elsewhere,
waiting for the next chapter,
the next achievement,
the next peace.
But each moment we wait,
we miss the one already given.

To realise deeply
that the present moment
is all you ever have
is to awaken from the trance of elsewhere.
It is to see that eternity
is not infinite time,
but timelessness.

Nothing exists outside this awareness.
Even the thought of "next"
arises now.
The universe is perpetually being born
in this breath,
this glance,
this heartbeat.

When you enter this realisation fully,
fear dissolves –
for what could the future threaten
when there is no future apart from now?
What could the past hold over you
when it has never been anywhere but here?

The present moment
is not a fragment of time.
It is the whole of existence
disguised as a single point.
To rest in it
is to live without remainder,
without chase,
without loss.

This is not philosophy;
it is salvation –
the return to what never left.

Realise deeply
that the present moment
is all you ever have,
and you will see:
you already possess
everything eternal.
