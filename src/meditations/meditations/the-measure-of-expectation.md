To give by expectation is to live by mirror.
To move only when reflected,
to love only when asked,
to offer only when the world reaches first.

"I know my flaw —
I only give what is expected."
It sounds like humility,
but it is a quiet kind of imprisonment.
Expectation becomes the boundary
of your generosity,
your truth,
your being.

Be it everything or nothing,
the measure is never your own.
You give to match,
not to express.
You serve to balance,
not to overflow.

Pause here.
Feel the weight of that rhythm.
Notice how it narrows your life—
how it trades authenticity
for control.
Expectation is safe,
but sterile.
It keeps you from being misread,
but it also keeps you from being real.

The soul was not built to trade energy
as transaction.
It was built to give because it overflows,
to act because it must,
to love without inventory.

To give only what is expected
is to live half a life.
To give from your own rhythm
is to let the divine move through you,
unmeasured.

You know your flaw.
That is the beginning of its undoing.
Next time the world waits for you to match its step,
choose instead to move first.
Not to please,
but to express.
Not to meet expectation,
but to exceed confinement.

Give what is true,
even if it surprises.
Even if it confuses.
For what you give from freedom
returns as life.
