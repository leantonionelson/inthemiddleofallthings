# The Point of Being

---

Three simple words.
An instruction, a revelation,
a doorway back to life:
Be here now.

Everything you seek – peace, meaning, love –
exists only within that command.
Not in the mind's rehearsals of the past,
nor in its anxious rehearsing of the future.
Only here.
Only now.

To be is to stop pretending.
To be here is to stop wandering.
To be now is to stop waiting.

Feel your breath move through you –
not as something to control,
but as evidence of presence.
This breath was not in the past.
The next breath is not promised.
Only this one lives.

The mind, restless traveller,
never stops searching for a better moment.
But the secret is cruelly simple:
there is no better moment.
There is only deeper presence.

To be here now
is not withdrawal from life,
it is entry into it.
The full inhabiting of experience
as it unfolds.
The willingness to meet reality
without condition.

The past can teach,
but it cannot touch you.
The future can inspire,
but it cannot feed you.
Only the now nourishes.

To be here now
is to dissolve the illusion of elsewhere.
To realise that you never left,
only forgot.

So stop running.
Stop planning.
Stop waiting for permission to exist.

Just –
be.
Here.
Now.

This is eternity condensed into a breath,
infinity disguised as a moment.
If you enter it fully,
you will see –
there was never anywhere else to go.
