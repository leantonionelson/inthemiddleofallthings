Death is the one promise life always keeps.
It waits, patient and impartial,
beyond our fears and philosophies.
We may not know what lies beyond,
but we can rest in this:
it will come,
and when it does,
we will finally know.

The beauty of death
is not in its ending,
but in its certainty.
It is the only question
that guarantees its own answer.

Pause here.
Let that truth settle.
Notice the calm that follows.
We spend our lives
running from the unknown,
and yet this final mystery
does not need to be solved—
only met.

Death strips away speculation.
It silences all pretending.
It brings equality to kings and children,
to saints and thieves.
And in that silence,
the noise of life's false importance fades.

The beauty of death
is that it will end every illusion.
The roles, the striving,
the endless rearranging of fears—
all dissolve into the simple light
of what is real.

We don't have to know which truth awaits us.
We only have to trust
that there is a truth.
One way or the other,
it will reveal itself.

Until then,
let death remind you how to live.
If the end is certain,
then what remains uncertain
is only how deeply you'll love,
how presently you'll be,
how fearlessly you'll meet the miracle
that precedes the silence.

The beauty of death
is that it ends the question.
But the beauty of life
is that it lets you ask.
