# The Weight of Enough

Try to spend time
free from consumption and greed.

Step outside the cycle of grasping —
the endless wanting,
buying, scrolling, proving.

Sit instead in sufficiency.
Let your worth
no longer depend on possession.

Pause here.
Think of something
you convinced yourself you needed.
Now imagine living without it —
notice how nothing essential vanishes.

Greed is a symptom of forgetting.
It arises when the soul feels small.
But when you return to presence,
to breath and body,
you remember:
you already have enough
to be alive.

Freedom begins
when want falls silent.
