# The Centre That Holds

We're always in the middle.

Between birth and death,
joy and sorrow,
certainty and doubt.
We live on the bridge
between extremes,
carrying the tension of both.

Think of a time
you were torn between two truths.
You were not lost –
you were alive.

The middle is not indecision.
It is dynamic balance.
It is the quiet strength
that holds opposites in conversation.

The centre does not choose sides.
It allows both to exist
without collapse.

To live in the middle
is to live where creation happens –
at the crossing point
of what was
and what might be.
