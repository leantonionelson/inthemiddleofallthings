# The Good Within the Great

**Tags:** ambition, morality, awareness, humility, compassion, purpose, balance, intention, integrity

---

In pursuit of great,
do not fail to do good.

Ambition without kindness
corrupts.
Purpose without presence
forgets its purpose.

Think of your greatest goal.
Now ask –
does it uplift others,
or only you?

Greatness is achieved
through goodness sustained.
The path to legacy
is paved with quiet decency.

Be excellent, yes –
but never at the cost of gentle.
