Reality rarely hurts as much as our resistance to it.
The pain we feel is often not born from what is,
but from what we believe about what is –
the mind's endless commentary,
its insistence that things should be otherwise.

The primary cause of unhappiness
is never the situation,
but your thoughts about it.

The situation is neutral.
It simply is.
Cold, hot, sudden, still –
the world moves by the laws of nature,
not the preferences of the ego.
Suffering arises when we argue with that movement,
when we demand of life
that it be different than it is.

Recall a recent moment of discontent.
Now strip it of its story –
of "should," of "why," of "unfair."
What remains?
Just sensation.
Just experience.
The situation itself rarely contains torment.
It is the mind's narration that deepens the wound.

Thought creates resistance,
and resistance hardens into unhappiness.
But when you drop the thought,
the emotion loses its foundation,
and what's left
is pure being –
untroubled, aware, still.

This is not denial.
It is clarity.
It is the recognition
that peace is not found
in changing the circumstance,
but in changing the relationship to it.

When you release the need
for life to match your expectation,
you discover that life, as it is,
was never against you.
It was simply moving
through the shapes it must take
to keep unfolding.

The situation does not imprison you;
the story does.
And the key has always been in your pocket –
awareness.
To see thought for what it is:
a passing cloud
mistaken for the sky.

So the next time unhappiness arises,
don't ask, "What is wrong with this moment?"
Ask, "What am I adding to it?"
Then fall silent,
and let reality speak for itself.

You may find
it was never cruel –
only misunderstood.
