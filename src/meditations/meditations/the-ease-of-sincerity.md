Laughter does not pretend.
It bursts.
It arrives unplanned,
unguarded,
spilling out of the body like light through glass.

This is what sincerity feels like.
A truth unforced.
A presence without mask.

To live in sincerity is not to perform honesty.
It is to carry yourself the way laughter carries itself—
effortless, unhidden, undeniable.

Pause here.
Think of a time you laughed so fully
that your body shook.
There was no strategy in it.
No calculation.
Only the recognition of life's absurdity,
its lightness,
its immediacy.

Now imagine if your being moved through the world
with that same freedom.
Speaking as laughter speaks.
Acting as laughter acts.
Not rehearsed.
Not explained.
Just true in the moment.

Sincerity is not heavy.
It is not solemn.
It is clear.
It is the rhythm of a life that has stopped pretending.

Live in sincerity, like laughter.
It does not mean you are always joyful.
It means you are always real.
Even your sorrow can be sincere.
Even your silence can ring like laughter—
felt, authentic, unafraid.

Ask yourself:
Where do I still perform?
Where do I still polish my truth before releasing it?
Where do I still hide the pulse of what I feel?

Then breathe.
And let sincerity surface—
as sudden, as uncontainable,
as liberating
as laughter breaking open the air.
