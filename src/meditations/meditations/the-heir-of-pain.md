Pain does not vanish;
it migrates.
It changes shape,
travelling unseen through blood and memory,
waiting for the one who will finally stop running.

Epigenetics is not just biology.
It is the soul's ledger.
The body remembers what the mind refuses.
The child carries what the ancestors could not.

Pain travels through families
until someone is ready to feel it —
to open the sealed room,
to breathe the dust,
to let the cry that never came.

Pause here.
Think of the grief that feels older than you —
sorrow without story,
fear without cause,
the heaviness that feels inherited.
You may be the one chosen to end it.
Not as punishment,
but as liberation.

When a lineage finds one
strong enough to sit in its unspoken ache,
healing begins.
The pain is not new;
it is ancient,
finally being seen.

You are not cursed.
You are called.
To feel it all is not to drown —
it is to cleanse the river.
To break the chain of silence
that has echoed through generations.

The ancestors stand behind you,
not watching,
but exhaling.
For every tear you release
is one they could not.
Every truth you name
frees them from their forgotten grief.

Pain travels through families
until it finds someone brave enough
to hold it with love instead of resistance.

If that someone is you,
breathe deeply.
You are not only healing yourself.
You are rewriting the DNA of mercy.
