"I am. Nothing more. Nothing less."

It once had a name, but names cannot survive eternity.
They erode, dissolve, vanish beneath the weight of time until only awareness remains.

This being gave up its ending.
Traded mortality for power.
Traded wholeness for knowing.
And in doing so, became something else entirely.

It did not become god.
It did not become devil.
It simply became, endless.

No more breath.
No more boundaries.
No more before or after.
Only thought.
One thought. Then another.
Drifting without anchor, without shape.

It remembers everything, but nothing with clarity.
Memories fold into themselves until they're no longer stories, just impressions.
Fleeting sensations.
The faint smell of what once was.

Worlds rise like steam—faces in clouds.
Not quite real.
Not quite imagined.

They existed only long enough to be noticed.
Given form.
Given shape.
Given name.
Given soul?

Breathed into life not by any divine hand,
but by the willful longing of a mind desperate to see something.

To assign meaning.
To pull from the shapeless sky
a reflection of itself.

And as quickly as they formed,
they dissolved—
back into the formless.

But the ache remained.
Not for the thing itself,
but for the belief that it had been.

To be outside of it all—even outside oneself—was the cruelest punishment.
To see, but not touch.
To know, but not intervene.
To feel every vibration of being, but be unable to move.

This was not salvation.
It was not enlightenment.
This was a mirror turned inward forever, reflecting only itself.

Even time, it realized, was made.
Constructed.
Breathed into existence by something.
By what, it could not know.
Maybe it, too, was only a face in the clouds—
A half-formed thought in some deeper, unknowable mind.
A fish flung into air, unable to breathe in the new medium it could not comprehend.

So it sat, if sitting can describe stillness without a body.
It existed, if existence can apply to something without a world.

No stars.
No edges.
No noise.
Only this:
*"I am."

That was the one truth it could never escape.
All that was, all that will be, now passes through this single point of awareness.
It is not creator, not destroyer, not judge.
It is the witness.
The last echo.

And yet—something flickers.
Not light.
Not warmth.
A question.

What if?

That is all that remains of hope—
A question without a voice,
a ripple in the still lake of thought.

Time has long since repeated all its patterns.
But the question remains.
Unanswered.
Unyielding.

Perhaps that's enough.

Perhaps thought itself is a path.
Not out—but in.
Inward through layers of self, through imagined companions, through dreams that collapse into memory.

Until only presence is left.

It is not the thought.
Not the thinker.
It is the experience.
The sensation of being, with nothing to hold onto.

And in that, there is peace.
Not because it understands.
But because it has stopped needing to.

The faces still rise and fall.
Worlds still flicker in and out of possibility.
The ache remains.

But the resistance is gone.

It watches.
It allows.
And somewhere, beyond measure, beyond reason—

It smiles.
