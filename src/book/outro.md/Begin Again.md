# Begin Again

Youâ€™ve reached the final page,  
but not the final word.

This work was **never** meant to lead you to a conclusion.  
It was meant to bring you home,  
to the place from which all motion begins:  
the middle.

You may be tempted to put it down now,  
to move on to something new.  
Thatâ€™s natural.

But perhaps, instead,  
you might turn back to the beginning.  
Not to repeat,  
but to deepen.  
To see what you missed the first time.  
To walk the spiral again  
with new eyes.

The words wonâ€™t have changed.  
But you will have.

This is the rhythm.  
This is the way.  
This is the middle of all things.

> Begin again.
