# 13. The Body as Compass

Your body remembers what the mind forgets.  
It knows before you know.  
It reacts before you understand.  
It carries the weight of every choice, every avoidance, every silent vow you never spoke aloud.

And it tells the truth, **always**.

Tension in the jaw.  
A subtle clench in the belly.  
A heaviness in the chest when you’re in the wrong place.  
A lightness in your limbs when you speak from alignment.

These are **not** symptoms.  
They are signals.  
The language of the self beyond thought.

We are taught to override these signals.  
To push through.  
To explain away.  
To intellectualise what the body already knows.

But if the body is a compass,  
then living well means learning to read it.  
Not through obsession,  
but through presence.

To ask:

> What is this discomfort trying to teach me?  
> What choice is my posture revealing?  
> What truth is my breath holding back?

Your body does **not** need to be perfect.  
It needs to be listened to.

And when you listen long enough,  
you begin to notice the difference  
between the ache of growth  
and the tension of misalignment;  
between exhaustion from movement  
and fatigue from self-betrayal.

You begin to discern:  
- Where you contract.  
- Where you expand.  
- Where you collapse.  
- Where you rise.

Ask yourself:

> **What have I been overriding in my body that wants to be honoured?**  
> **When in my day do I feel most physically aligned –what am I doing then?**  
> **What would it mean to trust my body as a source of wisdom, not resistance?**

This body is **not** a vehicle for becoming.  
It is part of your becoming.  
Not a shell.  
Not a tool.  
A centre of knowing.

You are **not** separate from it.  
You are **not** above it.  
You are the living axis between sensation and meaning.

And when you return to it,  
you return to yourself,  
not just in thought,  
but in form.

The mind may search.  
The spirit may long.  
But the body,  
the body knows.
