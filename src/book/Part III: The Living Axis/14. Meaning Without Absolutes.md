# **Chapter 14 – Meaning Without Absolutes**

For most of human history, meaning was assumed to be given.

By God.  
By nature.  
By reason.  
By destiny.

Meaning did not need to be discovered or negotiated.  
It was received.  
The task was alignment.

This assumption shaped civilisations.  
It stabilised behaviour.  
It ordered values.  
It gave suffering a context that did not require justification.

It also depended on certainty.

When the modern world began to question absolutes, it did so because they no longer held.  
The structures that once carried meaning began to fracture under their own weight.

Nietzsche recognised this collapse with clarity.  
When he wrote that “God is dead,” he was not announcing liberation.  
He was diagnosing the failure of a system that could no longer sustain belief.

What followed was not freedom.

It was vertigo.

Existential philosophy emerged to face this condition directly.  
Not to replace lost meaning,  
but to acknowledge that it could no longer be inherited.

Sartre argued that existence precedes essence – that we arrive without a script.  
Camus refused consolation, insisting that the absurd must be faced without appeal.  
The Stoics, centuries earlier, had already begun drawing a boundary between what is given and what remains within our control.

Across these traditions, a shared recognition appears.

Meaning is no longer guaranteed by structure.  
It must be lived without final justification.

Meaning does not disappear.  
Its foundation shifts.

Instead of resting on universals, it rests on orientation.  
Instead of being inherited, it is sustained.  
Instead of being proven, it is enacted.

This shift is destabilising.

Without absolutes, there is no final authority to appeal to.  
No explanation that resolves contradiction.  
No guarantee that what you are doing will matter in the way you hope.

Philosophy does not remove this condition.  
It makes it visible.

The existential task is not to invent meaning arbitrarily,  
but to live coherently in a landscape without guarantees.

This is where many retreat.

Absolutes are replaced with identities, ideologies, or narratives strong enough to simulate certainty.  
Structure is substituted rather than examined.

But substitution does not restore ground.

To live without absolutes is not to live without direction.  
It is to accept that direction must be continually re-chosen.

This chapter does not answer the question of meaning.  
It releases the expectation that the answer will arrive intact.

What follows is not resolution,  
but an examination of how meaning behaves  
once certainty is no longer its foundation.

The ground has shifted.

It is no longer solid.

But it remains real.
