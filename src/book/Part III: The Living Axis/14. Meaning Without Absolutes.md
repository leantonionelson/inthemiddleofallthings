# **Chapter 14 – Meaning Without Absolutes**

For most of human history, meaning was assumed to be given.

Not discovered, not negotiated – given.  
By God, by nature, by reason, by destiny.  
The task was not to create meaning, but to align with it.

This assumption shaped entire civilisations.  
It stabilised behaviour.  
It ordered values.  
It gave suffering a context it did not need to justify itself.

But it also depended on something fragile: certainty.

When the modern world began to question absolutes, it did not do so lightly.  
It did so because they no longer held.

Nietzsche saw this fracture clearly.  
When he declared that “God is dead,” he was not celebrating.  
He was diagnosing a collapse in the structures that once guaranteed meaning.

What followed was not freedom, but vertigo.

Existential philosophy emerged not to answer the question of meaning,  
but to face the fact that it could no longer be outsourced.

Sartre argued that existence precedes essence – that we arrive without a script.  
Camus refused consolation, insisting that the absurd must be faced without appeal.  
The Stoics, centuries earlier, had already begun this work by drawing a sharp line between what is given and what remains within our control.

Across these traditions, a shared insight appears:

Meaning is no longer guaranteed by structure.  
It must be lived without final justification.

This does not mean meaning disappears.  
It means its foundation changes.

Instead of resting on universals, it rests on orientation.  
Instead of being inherited, it is sustained.  
Instead of being proven, it is enacted.

This is deeply uncomfortable.

Without absolutes, there is no final authority to appeal to.  
No ultimate explanation that resolves contradiction.  
No guarantee that what you are doing will matter in the way you hope.

Philosophy does not rescue us from this condition.  
It clarifies it.

The existential task is not to invent meaning arbitrarily,  
but to live coherently inside its absence of guarantees.

This is where many retreat.  
They rush to replace absolutes with identities, ideologies, or narratives strong enough to simulate certainty.

But substitution is not resolution.

To live without absolutes is not to live without direction.  
It is to accept that direction must be continually re-chosen.

This chapter does not answer the question of meaning.  
It removes the expectation that the answer will arrive whole.

What follows is not a solution,  
but an exploration of how meaning behaves  
once certainty is no longer its foundation.

The ground is no longer solid.

But it is real.
