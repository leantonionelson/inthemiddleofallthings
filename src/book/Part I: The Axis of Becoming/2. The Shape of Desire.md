# 2. The Shape of Desire

Once you see what you are already becoming,  
you cannot unsee it.

It might comfort you.  
It might disturb you.  
It might feel like a long-forgotten truth finally rising to the surface.  
But whatever it is, it is yours.  
It was always there,  
in the patterns of your days,  
the tone of your thoughts,  
the way your body moves when no one is watching.

And now that it is seen,  
the question becomes:  
*Is this what I truly want to become?*

This is **not** a question of dreams or goals.  
It is a question of alignment.  
Not what you fantasise about at your peak,  
but what your being resonates with at rest.  
What fits the grain of your soul.

Desire is **not** always loud.  
Sometimes it’s a whisper beneath the noise.  
Sometimes it’s buried beneath the expectations of others.  
Sometimes it’s been so long ignored, it begins to masquerade as fatigue.

But true desire, the kind worth listening to, does **not** shout.  
It draws.  
It feels like gravity.  
Not the gravity of obligation, but of returning.  
A coming home.

And yet, not every desire is trustworthy.  
Some are inherited.  
Some are reactions.  
Some are cravings dressed as purpose.

So before you follow a desire, ask it questions:

- **Where did you come from?**  
- **What need are you trying to meet?**  
- **Will you still be here when I’m tired, bored, uncertain?**  
- **Do you feed my becoming, or just my avoidance?**

True desire will **not** flinch when questioned.  
It will **not** bristle.  
It will settle,  
like something that has been waiting for you to catch up.

And once it settles, it becomes a compass.  
Not a map, not a guarantee,  
but a direction.

Now pause.  
Ask yourself gently, without pressure:

> What do I want to become, not as a role, but as a presence?

> If I walked toward that quietly, what would I need to leave behind?

> Can I live with the cost of becoming that person?

You do **not** need to answer all at once.  
But you do need to listen.

Desire is **not** indulgence.  
It is guidance, when it is clean.  
And you cleanse it by witnessing it fully,  
asking it to speak its origin,  
and letting the false ones fall away.

You are not here to chase someone else’s becoming.  
You are here to choose your own,  
but only once you know its true shape.
