# 11. Time and the Myth of Readiness

You keep waiting.  
For more clarity.  
For more confidence.  
For a sign, a shift, a season where everything aligns just right.

You tell yourself you’re **not** ready.  
That it would be reckless to begin too soon.  
That you need more time.

But time is **not** a gatekeeper.  
It is a canvas, blank until you mark it.

The idea of readiness often disguises a deeper truth: fear.  
Fear of failure.  
Fear of irreversibility.  
Fear of stepping into a version of yourself you can no longer retreat from.

So you rehearse your becoming in your mind,  
perfecting it in theory,  
never risking it in form.

But readiness is **not** a state of being.  
It is a consequence of movement.  
You become ready by beginning.

Waiting does **not** prepare you.  
It only conditions you to wait better.  
It teaches your body to associate insight with pause,  
intuition with paralysis.  
And soon, even your inspiration arrives with a leash.

The truth is, you will never feel fully ready.  
And that is **not** a flaw.  
It is the nature of thresholds—  
they cannot be crossed without friction.

There is **no** perfect time.  
There is only alignment,  
and your willingness to move when the pull within you becomes louder than the noise outside you.

Ask yourself:

> **What am I waiting for that may never arrive?**  
> **What have I already delayed that my spirit has already said yes to?**  
> **What would happen if I stopped negotiating with time and started living from alignment?**

Time does **not** hold your becoming.  
You do.

Every moment you wait is another moment you teach yourself to distrust your readiness.  
But every moment you act, even in small, imperfect steps,  
you rebuild that trust.

You are **not** waiting for the right moment.  
You are becoming it.

And when you finally move,  
you will look back and see,  
you were ready the moment you stopped waiting.
