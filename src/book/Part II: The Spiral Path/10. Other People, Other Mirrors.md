# 10. Other People, Other Mirrors

No matter how deep your self-work,  
you cannot see yourself fully  
until you meet your reflection  
in someone else.

Other people are **not** detours on the path.  
They are the path,  
stretching you, challenging you, mirroring you.

You will know which part of yourself still resists integration  
by how you react when others reveal it.  

The traits that irritate you.  
The praise you can’t accept.  
The discomfort you feel around certain kinds of presence.  

These are clues.  
Not to judge them,  
but to see yourself more clearly.

Relationships, whether fleeting or enduring,  
are mirrors with unique curvatures:  
- Some reflect your beauty.  
- Some magnify your distortion.  
- Some reveal truths you’ve hidden even from yourself.

None of them are perfect.  
But all of them are teachers.

You will attract what you need to grow.  
Not what is easy.  
Not what always affirms you.  
But what resonates with your becoming,  
whether through harmony or friction.

Ask yourself:

- **Who in my life consistently calls me into alignment?**  
- **Who reveals patterns I haven’t yet owned?**  
- **Where do I perform instead of relate?**

Some people arrive as accelerants.  
Some as anchors.  
Some as echoes of your former self,  
asking you to love what you once abandoned.

Not everyone will stay.  
And not everyone should.  
But every person you encounter leaves a fingerprint,  
not on your soul,  
but on the story your soul tells about itself.  

And in that way, they become part of your narrative.  
Not the centre of it,  
but not outside it either.

Even your enemies shape your becoming.  
Even your silences in conversation teach you something.

You are **not** an island.  
You are a porous, rhythmic, relational self.  
Boundaried, yes,  
but responsive.

To live well among others is **not** to lose yourself.  
It is to learn what parts of you are still conditional,  
still reactive,  
still becoming.

And to do that,  
you must be willing to look at what they show you,  
and **not** flinch.

Because in the end,  
you are not just becoming you.  
You are becoming you in the world.  
And the world will always hold a mirror.
