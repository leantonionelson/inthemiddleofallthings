# 7. The Spiral Path

You thought you had moved on.  
Crossed a threshold.  
Left behind the old patterns, the doubts, the distortions.  
And yet,  
here they are again.  
Different form, same taste.

It’s tempting to feel disappointed.  
To think: *I’ve already dealt with this.*  
But growth does **not** move in a line.  
It moves in spirals.

Each time you return to an old pattern,  
you are **not** failing,  
you are seeing it from a new elevation.

The spiral path is **not** circular stagnation.  
It is repetition with difference.  
Each cycle brings you closer to the centre,  
or wider into expansion,  
depending on the direction of your attention.

This is why the same challenge can appear again,  
but feel different.  
Because you are different.  
You meet it with more awareness.  
More patience.  
Or more strength than before.  
And sometimes less.  
Because the spiral also reveals what you have not integrated.  
Where your growth is still performative.  
Where your transformation has not reached the body.  
The breath.  
The bone.

This is **not** a failure.  
This is fidelity to the process.

We tend to crave finality.  
We want to be done.  
We want our wounds to close,  
our doubts to quiet,  
our selves to stabilise.

But becoming isn’t a task to complete.  
It is a rhythm to live within.  
A spiralling rhythm that brings us again and again  
to the edges of our comfort,  
not to punish us,  
but to refine us.

So when the old returns, ask:

- **What is familiar in this pattern, and what is new?**  
- **How does my response today differ from the last time I faced this?**  
- **What am I being asked to integrate that I previously only understood?**

Growth is **not** upward.  
It is inward.  
Outward.  
Backward.  
Forward.

It is directionless in the way breath is directionless,  
expansion and contraction  
moving through a central rhythm.

The spiral path humbles you.  
It quiets the ego that wants to graduate,  
to ascend,  
to arrive.

It invites you instead to remain,  
in motion,  
in awareness,  
in practice.

You are **not** lost.  
You are circling the centre,  
drawing it clearer  
with every turn.
