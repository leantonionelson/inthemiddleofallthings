# **Chapter 10 – Shedding Mass**

Every object with mass is attracted to every other.

The most fundamental of these forces is gravity – the curvature of the very substrate of existence.  
Matter bends space.  
Space directs motion.

Nothing moves in isolation.

At the multidimensional level of relationships, this attraction takes many forms.  
Attention.  
Attachment.  
Expectation.  
Need.

Some configurations are stable.  
They regulate energy, preserve coherence, and allow systems to endure.

Others are fractious.  
Chaotic.  
They demand constant correction, constant effort, constant vigilance.

These orbits do not fail all at once.  
They tighten.  
They distort movement.  
They drain the system until collapse becomes inevitable.

There are only a few ways an orbit changes.

Most people try the first one.

They add speed.

They push harder, speak louder, demand clarity, escalate effort.  
They argue their way out.  
They prove their way out.  
They accelerate.

In physics, this is called escape velocity – the energy required to overcome gravitational pull.

In life, it looks like conflict.

The cost is high.  
You burn fuel.  
You leave damage.  
Sometimes you break free, but you are exhausted by the attempt.

So people try the second way.

They slow down.

They stop pushing.  
They withdraw.  
They numb.  
They collapse inward.

In physics, this is orbital decay – the loss of motion until gravity wins and the body falls inward.

In life, it looks like resignation.

You stay, but smaller.  
You survive, but compressed.  
The orbit tightens until identity erodes.

Both of these approaches rely on force.

One spends it.  
The other loses it.

Almost no one considers the third option.

You do not change speed.  
You do not collapse.

You become lighter.

In physics, gravity acts on mass.  
Reduce the mass and the same gravitational field loses its grip.

The pull has not changed.  
You have.

In human terms, mass is not your body.  
It is what you are carrying.

Your ego.  
Your grievance.  
Your need to be right.  
Your attachment to outcome.  
The story you keep alive long after it has stopped serving you.

This is the weight.

As long as you remain heavy with significance, gravity holds you.

This is why insight alone does not free you.  
You can understand the pattern perfectly and still remain bound.

Understanding does not reduce mass.  
Letting go does.

Lightness does not mean stopping.

An orbit only breaks if velocity is preserved.

If you shed mass but lose motion, you fall inward.  
If you maintain motion but remain heavy, you keep circling.

Freedom requires both.

Letting go costs energy – but it is not the same energy as force.  
It is internal.  
Quiet.  
Continuous.

In physics, this process already exists.

It is called decay.

Unstable structures do not fight to remain intact.  
They release what they cannot hold.  
They shed excess energy and settle into configurations that require less effort to maintain.

Nothing is attacking.  
Nothing is collapsing.  
The system is becoming honest about what no longer belongs.

The universe prefers efficiency.

What looks like effort from the outside is often relief from within.

Shedding mass works the same way.

You continue moving.  
You keep your direction.  
You maintain your velocity.

But you stop reinforcing what makes you dense.

You stop rehearsing the argument.  
You stop feeding the resentment.  
You stop carrying armour that once protected you but now weighs you down.

Nothing dramatic happens.

The relationship does not explode.  
The situation does not resolve.  
The field is unchanged.

But the grip loosens.

You notice you can hear without defending.  
You can move without reacting.  
You can stay without bracing.

The orbit begins to widen on its own.

Shedding mass does not dictate outcome.

A lighter object may leave an orbit entirely.  
Or it may settle into one that is stable, sustainable, and no longer costly.

The difference is not where you end up,  
but how much effort it takes to remain there.

This was never about leaving or staying.

It was about balance.

The middle of all things is not a fixed point.  
It is a living one.

To shed mass is not to reject gravity,  
but to move within it without being owned by it.
