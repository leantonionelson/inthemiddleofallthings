# **Chapter 10 – Shedding Mass**

Every object with mass is attracted to every other.

At the most fundamental level, this attraction is gravity – the curvature of the substrate of existence itself.  
Matter bends space.  
Space directs motion.

Nothing moves in isolation.

In the multidimensional field of relationships, attraction takes many forms.  
Attention.  
Attachment.  
Expectation.  
Need.

Some configurations are stable.  
They regulate energy, preserve coherence, and allow systems to endure.

Others are fractious.  
Chaotic.  
They demand constant correction, vigilance, and effort.

These orbits rarely fail all at once.  
They tighten.  
They distort movement.  
They drain the system until collapse becomes inevitable.

There are only a few ways an orbit changes.

Most people attempt the first.

They add speed.

They push harder, speak louder, demand clarity, escalate effort.  
They argue their way out.  
They prove their way out.  
They accelerate.

In physics, this is escape velocity – the energy required to overcome gravitational pull.

In life, it appears as conflict.

The cost is high.  
Fuel burns quickly.  
Damage accumulates.  
Sometimes freedom is achieved, but exhaustion arrives with it.

So people attempt the second way.

They slow down.

They stop pushing.  
They withdraw.  
They numb.  
They fold inward.

In physics, this is orbital decay – the loss of motion until gravity pulls the body inward.

In life, it resembles resignation.

Presence remains, but compressed.  
Survival continues, but diminished.  
The orbit tightens until identity erodes.

No orbit changes while the system continues to carry the weight that binds it.

Both approaches rely on force.

One expends it.  
The other relinquishes it.

A third option exists.

Speed remains.  
Collapse does not occur.

Mass is reduced.

In physics, gravity acts on mass.  
When mass decreases, the same gravitational field exerts less hold.

The field is unchanged.  
The object is not.

In human terms, mass is what you carry.

Ego.  
Grievance.  
The need to be right.  
Attachment to outcome.  
Stories kept alive long after they have ceased to serve.

This is the weight.

As long as significance is reinforced, gravity retains its grip.

This is why insight alone rarely frees anyone.  
Patterns can be understood precisely while remaining intact.

Understanding maps the structure.  
Release alters the mass.

Lightness does not imply stopping.

An orbit only breaks if motion is preserved.

Shed mass without motion and the system falls inward.  
Maintain motion while remaining heavy and the system continues to circle.

Freedom requires both.

Letting go consumes energy, though not the kind spent through force.  
It is internal.  
Quiet.  
Sustained.

Physics already contains this process.

It is called decay.

Unstable structures do not fight to remain intact.  
They release what cannot be held.  
Excess energy dissipates.  
The system settles into a configuration requiring less effort to maintain.

Nothing attacks.  
Nothing collapses.  
The structure becomes honest about what no longer belongs.

The universe prefers efficiency.

What appears as effort externally is often relief internally.

Shedding mass follows the same logic.

Motion continues.  
Direction remains.  
Velocity is preserved.

What changes is what is no longer reinforced.

Arguments are no longer rehearsed.  
Resentments are no longer fed.  
Armour that once protected but now burdens is set down.

Nothing dramatic occurs.

The relationship does not rupture.  
The situation does not resolve.  
The field remains the same.

Yet the grip loosens.

Hearing occurs without defence.  
Movement occurs without reaction.  
Presence occurs without bracing.

The orbit widens on its own.

Shedding mass does not dictate outcome.

A lighter object may exit an orbit entirely.  
Or it may settle into one that is stable, sustainable, and no longer costly.

The difference lies elsewhere.

Not in where you end up,  
but in the effort required to remain there.

This was never about leaving or staying.

It was about load.

The middle of all things is not fixed.  
It is living.

To shed mass is to move within gravity  
without being owned by it.
