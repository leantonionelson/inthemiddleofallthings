# **Part II – The External Forces of Becoming**

This part examines change as it meets the world.

No self moves in isolation.  
Other people exert gravity.  
Circumstances apply pressure.  
Time curves trajectories.  
Attachment creates orbit.  
Interaction reshapes direction.

Here, an internal axis enters a field of forces.  
Lives bend, loop, collide, stabilise, or destabilise in relation to what surrounds them.  
Becoming is no longer private.  
It unfolds through proximity, duration, and exposure.

Movement follows interaction.  
Paths curve under influence.  
Systems entrain or resist one another.  
Patterns repeat through feedback.  
Stability emerges through balance rather than control.

This part traces the geometry that forms  
when an inner structure moves  
through a world already in motion.
