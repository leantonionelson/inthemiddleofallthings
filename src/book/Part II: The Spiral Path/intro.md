# **Part II – The External Forces of Becoming**

This part explores the structure of change as it meets the world.

No self moves in isolation.  
Other people exert gravity.  
Circumstances introduce pressure.  
Time curves trajectories.  
Attachment creates orbit.  
Interaction reshapes direction.

These chapters examine what happens when an internal axis enters a field of forces – how lives bend, loop, collide, stabilise, or destabilise in relation to what surrounds them.  
Here, becoming is no longer private. It is relational, temporal, and dynamic.

Movement follows interaction.  
Paths curve under influence.  
Systems entrain or resist one another.  
Patterns repeat through feedback.  
Stability emerges through balance, not control.

This part traces the geometry that forms when an inner structure moves through a world already in motion.
