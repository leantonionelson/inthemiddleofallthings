# 22. The Silence That Holds Us

There are things you will **never** understand.  
Not because you are unworthy of knowing,  
but because they are not meant to be grasped.  
Only witnessed.  
Only felt.

We want meaning.  
We want certainty.  
We want language to carry us all the way through.  
But some truths are too vast for words.  
Too intimate for definition.  
Too essential to be named.

And so they arrive in silence.  
Not absence.  
But presence without shape.

The silence that holds us is **not** empty.  
It is full—  
of everything we cannot carry with the mind,  
but somehow know in the bones.

It is there  
when you sit at the edge of grief and find no answers.  
It is there  
in the moment after beauty overwhelms you and words fall away.  
It is there  
in the breath before sleep,  
in the pause after music,  
in the glance between souls where something ancient is exchanged.

This silence is **not** what comes after meaning.  
It is what surrounds it.  
What makes it possible.  
What reminds you:  
*You are not here to solve everything.*  
*You are here to be present with what cannot be solved.*

Ask yourself, not aloud, but inwardly:

> **Where do I try to speak when silence is more true?**  
> **What have I sensed that I could never quite explain?**  
> **Can I sit with the mystery, not as a puzzle, but as a companion?**

To live well is **not** to fill every space.  
It is to trust the ones that remain open.  
To know that clarity is not the only form of wisdom—  
sometimes, reverence is enough.

You are held.  
Even when you don’t understand what’s holding you.

You don’t need to define the silence.  
You need only to respect it.  
And in that respect,  
you may come to feel  
not the need for an answer,  
but the deep, steady belonging  
of being part of something that never needed words.
