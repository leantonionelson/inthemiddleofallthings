23. The Spiral Never Ends
This is not the end.
 It never was.
You’ve circled truths.
 You’ve stretched into new shapes.
 You’ve folded back into old selves,
 and met them with new presence.
 You’ve remembered, forgotten, remembered again.
This is the nature of the spiral.
 It turns.
 Not forward. Not backward.
 But inward. Outward. Deeper. Wider.
You are not arriving at a destination.
 You are arriving at a widened centre.
 Still you, 
 but more whole, more present, more tuned to the rhythm of your becoming.
The self is not something you discover.
 It is something you practice.
 Moment by moment.
 Turn by turn.
And each time you forget,
 you will return.
 Each time you fall,
 you will remember how to rise.
 Each time you lose your rhythm,
 you will listen for the breath that brings you back.
There is no finish line.
 No final version.
 Just you, 
 alive in the tension,
 still choosing,
 still refining,
 still becoming.
You do not graduate from this work.
 You are not meant to.
You are meant to live in the middle, 
 with your axis intact,
 your awareness awake,
 and your heart open to what this moment is becoming through you.
So before you close this page, ask once more:
What am I already becoming?


Is that aligned with what I want to become?


What will I choose next, knowing the spiral never ends?


There is no need to rush.
 No need to perfect.
 Only to return, 
 again and again, 
 to this quiet centre
 from which everything is possible.
The work is not behind you.
 It is not ahead of you.
 It is with you.
It is you.
And that is enough.
