# Introduction: A Centre That Moves

This is **not** a book of answers.  
It’s a book of positions. Of orientations. Of quiet fires and sharp edges.

I write from the middle, not as a compromise, but as a vantage point.  
From here, I can see both extremes, feel their pull, know their consequence.  
The middle is not a place of neutrality. It is the convergence point of becoming.  
Every direction is available. Every tension, instructive. Every choice, sacred.

This is **not** philosophy in the abstract. It is a mirror held up to your being.  
You do **not** read it. You **meet** it.

> Pause between the words.  
> Reflect.  
> And when you’re ready, act.
