# Deployment Fixes Required

## 1. Firebase Security Rules Setup

The "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors occur because Firebase security rules need to be configured. 

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `inthemiddleofallthings`
3. **Navigate to Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. **Replace the existing rules with**:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage their own progress
    match /userProgress/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage their own highlights
    match /highlights/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage their own reading sessions
    match /readingSessions/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Click "Publish"**

## 2. Email Already In Use Error

If you get "email already in use" error:
- The account already exists with that email
- Use the **Sign In** option instead of **Create Account**
- Or try a different email address

## 3. Navigation Issues Fixed

✅ **Fixed in latest code**:
- Authentication state now persists on page reload
- Proper Firebase auth listener setup
- Better error handling for permissions

## 4. PWA Icon Warning

The PWA icon warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality. It will be resolved in the next update.

## After Setting Up Firebase Rules:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload the app
2. **Try logging in** with your existing email/password
3. **Test navigation** - should work properly now

## If Issues Persist:

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Ensure you're using the correct email/password combination
3. Try signing out and signing in again
4. Contact if Firebase rules setup needs assistance

The deployment should work correctly once the Firebase security rules are properly configured!
