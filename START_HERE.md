## 🗂️ **Ignore These Old Docs**

- ❌ AUDIO_FIX.md (old issue)
- ❌ AUDIO_GENERATION.md (outdated)
- ❌ AUDIO_OPTIMIZATION.md (reference only)
- ❌ AUDIO_REGENERATION_GUIDE.md (too complex)

**Only use:** THIS FILE (START_HERE.md)

---

## 🐛 **If Something Goes Wrong**

### "API key not set"
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"
Wait a few hours, then retry the failed command

### "No audio data received"
- Check your API key is valid
- Verify you have API quota
- Try one file at a time

## 📊 **After Regeneration**

1. **Test in browser:**
   - Clear cache (F12 → Application → Clear site data)
   - Navigate to Meditations
   - Click play on a meditation
   - Should hear clear, natural audio

2. **Verify files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh public/media/audio/meditations/*.wav
   ls -lh public/media/audio/stories/*.wav
   ```

3. **Deploy (when ready):**
   ```bash
   # Your deployment command here
   ```
